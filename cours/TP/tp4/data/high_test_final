    "output": "Abrosaurus – an early sauropod dinosaur known from the Middle Jurassic of what is now north‑central China.\n\nSize  \nThe animal was medium‑sized for a sauropod, estimated to reach about 9 to 12 metres (30–40 ft) in length and to weigh roughly 4–5 tonnes. The neck was relatively short compared with later giant sauropods, and the body was low‑slung and robust.\n\nPeriod range  \nAbrosaurus lived during the Middle Jurassic, specifically the Bajocian to Bathonian stages, about 170 to 165 million years ago.\n\nFossil locations  \nAll confirmed specimens have been recovered from the Lower Shaximiao Formation (also called the Shaximiao Group) near the city of Zigong in Sichuan Province, China. Isolated bones and a partial skeleton have been collected from several quarry sites along the Yangtze River basin.\n\nPhysical description  \nThe dinosaur possessed a typical sauropod body plan: a long tail, a short, deep torso, and a columnar limb posture. Its skull was low and broad, with a modestly developed beak‑like rostrum and small, leaf‑shaped teeth arranged in a simple, spatulate row. The neck comprised about twelve relatively stout cervical vertebrae, indicating a feeding height limited to low‑ to mid‑level vegetation. The dorsal vertebrae show the early development of pleurocoels (air‑filled cavities), a trait that would become more pronounced in later sauropods. The forelimbs were slightly shorter than the hindlimbs, giving the animal a somewhat sloping back. Skin impressions are unknown, but it is presumed to have been covered in small, polygonal scales like other basal sauropods.\n\nFossil records  \nThe first material was described in 1979 by paleontologist Dong Zhiming, based on a partial skeleton that included several vertebrae, ribs, a left humerus, and a fragmentary pelvis. Since then, additional isolated vertebrae and limb elements have been attributed to Abrosaurus from the same formation, expanding knowledge of its anatomy. No complete skull or articulated skeleton has yet been found, so reconstructions rely heavily on comparative anatomy with better‑known contemporaneous sauropods such as Shunosaurus and Bellusaurus. The known material is stored primarily in the Zigong Dinosaur Museum and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing.\n\nDiet description  \nAbrosaurus was a herbivore that likely fed on low‑lying gymnosperm foliage, such as cycads, bennettitaleans, and early conifers. The blunt, spatulate teeth suggest a browsing strategy that involved stripping leaves rather than selective chewing. The relatively short neck would have kept its feeding envelope close to the ground, probably up to about 2 metres (6 ft) in height, allowing it to exploit vegetation unavailable to smaller herbivores.\n\nEnvironmental description  \nDuring the Middle Jurassic, the Shaximiao region was a humid, seasonally wet floodplain dotted with river channels, lakes, and occasional swampy marshes. The climate was warm and temperate, supporting extensive coniferous forests, dense growths of ferns, horsetails, and the aforementioned gymnosperm plants. Periodic volcanic activity in the surrounding highlands contributed ash layers that aided fossil preservation. This mosaic of water‑rich lowlands and forested uplands provided abundant food resources for large herbivores like Abrosaurus, while predators such as early theropods (e.g., Sinosauropteryx) would have roamed the same habitats.",

    "output": "Abydosaurus is a relatively modest‑sized sauropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous, roughly between 85 and 80 million years ago, in what is now the western United States.  \n\nSize  \nAdult individuals are estimated to have measured about 12 to 14 metres (40–45 ft) in length and stood approximately 3 metres (10 ft) high at the shoulder. Their mass is thought to have been in the range of 7–9 tonnes, comparable to a modern African elephant.  \n\nGeological period and range  \nAbydosaurus is known from the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, a time when the interior of North America was a broad coastal plain punctuated by river systems and low‑lying floodplains.  \n\nFossil locations  \nThe only confirmed specimens come from the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation in eastern Utah, United States. The type specimen (MOR 1150) was recovered near the town of Hyrum in 2000. Additional referred material has been collected from nearby exposures within the same stratigraphic unit.  \n\nPhysical description  \nAbydosaurus belonged to the titanosauriform group of sauropods, displaying the classic long neck and tail of its relatives. Its skull was relatively small and narrow, with a long, low snout and enlarged, leaf‑shaped teeth that were set in a robust, double‑row arrangement. The neck comprised at least fifteen cervical vertebrae, each elongated and lightly built, allowing a wide range of motion for high browsing. The dorsal vertebrae possessed broad, shallow neural arches and well‑developed chevron plates. Its forelimbs were columnar and robust, supporting the animal’s massive torso, while the hind limbs were slightly more slender but still capable of bearing great weight. The tail was long and tapered, likely used for balance and possibly as a defensive whip. Skin impressions are not known, but related titanosaurs are thought to have had a mosaic of small, polygonal scales interspersed with larger, keeled osteoderms along the flanks.  \n\nFossil record  \nThe type specimen consists of a partial skull, several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, portions of the fore‑ and hind‑limb bones, as well as a series of isolated teeth. The skull is one of the most complete sauropod skulls from the Campanian of North America, providing valuable data on cranial anatomy that is rarely preserved in this group. Additional isolated teeth and vertebral fragments from the same formation have been attributed to Abydosaurus based on distinctive morphological traits such as the shape of the tooth crown and the unique laminae pattern on the dorsal vertebrae. The relatively good preservation suggests rapid burial in a low‑energy fluvial environment, perhaps a floodplain overbank deposit.  \n\nDiet  \nLike other sauropods, Abydosaurus was a high‑browsing herbivore. Its leaf‑shaped, spatulate teeth were adapted for stripping foliage rather than grinding, indicating a diet of soft to moderately tough vegetation such as conifer needles, cycads, ferns, and the occasional flowering plant (early angiosperms). The long neck would have allowed it to reach vegetation at varying heights, from low shrubs up to the mid‑canopy of coniferous trees. No direct evidence of gastroliths has been found with the specimens, but it is plausible that it used swallowed stones to help pulverize plant material in its massive gut.  \n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Campanian, the area that is now eastern Utah was part of a broad, low‑lying coastal plain bordering the Western Interior Seaway. The climate was semi‑arid to subtropical, with seasonal rainfall that supported a mosaic of ecosystems: river channels and oxbow lakes, flood‑plain mudflats, and scattered upland patches of forest. Vegetation was dominated by coniferous trees (such as araucarians and podocarps), ginkgoes, cycads, and a growing diversity of angiosperms. Open fern‑rich understories and horsetail stands thrived along the watercourses. The presence of abundant water sources and lush vegetation would have provided ample foraging opportunities for large herbivores like Abydosaurus, while predators such as tyrannosaurids and dromaeosaurids would have occupied the same habitats, preying on juveniles or sick individuals.  \n\nIn summary, Abydosaurus was a medium‑sized, late‑Cretaceous titanosauriform sauropod known from the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah. Its relatively complete skull and distinctive vertebral features make it a key taxon for understanding sauropod evolution in North America, while its size, dental morphology, and the paleoenvironmental context together paint a picture of a high‑browsing herbivore thriving on the lush, flood‑plains that fringed the ancient Western Interior Seaway.",

    "output": "**Acantholipan Overview**  \n\nAcantholipan (meaning “spiny shield”) is a genus of armored, herbivorous ankylosaurian dinosaurs belonging to the family Nodosauridae. It is known from the Late Cretaceous of what is now northern Mexico and represents one of the few ankylosaur taxa described from South‑North America’s southernmost dinosaur faunas.\n\n**Size**  \n- Length: approximately 5 to 6 metres (16–20 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height: about 1.5 metres (5 ft) at the shoulder when the animal was in a normal, quadrupedal stance.  \n- Body mass: estimated 1.5–2.0 tonnes, comparable to a modern rhinoceros.\n\n**Geologic Time Range**  \n- Age: Campanian to early Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous, roughly 72–68 million years ago. The exact range is based on the stratigraphic position of the fossil‑bearing beds in the Difunta Group of Coahuila, Mexico.\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- Primary site: The “Acañón del Río Conchos” locality within the Campanian‑Maastrichtian “Difunta Group” (formerly the “Mogollón Formation”) near the town of Múzquiz, Coahuila, northern Mexico.  \n- Additional material: Isolated osteoderms and vertebral fragments attributed to Acantholipan have been recovered from nearby outcrops of the same formation, strengthening the geographic range within the northern Mexican basin.\n\n**Physical Description**  \n- **Skull:** Broad and low, with a short snout and a beak‑like keratinous rhamphotheca for cropping vegetation. The skull lacks the large tail club seen in some ankylosaurids, consistent with its nodosaurid affinities.  \n- **Armor:** The dorsal surface is covered by a dense array of osteoderms (bony plates) of varying size. Prominent lateral “spikes” project from the hips and shoulders, giving the genus its name. The cervical (neck) region is protected by a series of keeled plates forming a flexible “shield” that could deflect predators.  \n- **Limbs:** Robust, columnar fore‑ and hindlimbs ending in broad, blunt unguals. The forelimbs are slightly shorter than the hindlimbs, a typical ankylosaur condition.  \n- **Tail:** Long and relatively slender compared to ankylosaurids, ending in a series of small, overlapping plates rather than a massive club.  \n- **Body Cover:** In addition to the bony armor, the animal likely possessed a keratinous sheath over many osteoderms, possibly giving a rough, scaly appearance.\n\n**Fossil Record and Specimen Details**  \n- Holotype: Specimen CCG‑M 2012‑001, an articulated partial skeleton preserving the skull, cervical series, anterior trunk, left forelimb, and a substantial portion of the tail. The holotype includes over 70 osteoderms, providing detailed insight into armor morphology.  \n- Paratypes and referred material: Several isolated osteoderms, a partial pelvis, and a few vertebrae (specimens CCG‑M 2013‑004, CCG‑M 2014‑011) that confirm the presence of the species in contemporaneous strata.  \n- Preservation: The fossils are found in fine‑grained sandstones and mudstones indicative of low‑energy floodplain deposits, with occasional limestone nodules that have preserved delicate cranial elements.  \n- Taphonomy: The remains show minimal transport abrasion, suggesting the animals died near the site of burial, perhaps after a sudden flood event.\n\n**Dietary Characteristics**  \nAcantholipan was a strict herbivore. Its beaked mouth and low‑lying dental battery, composed of leaf‑shaped cheek teeth with coarse enamel ridges, were adapted for grinding high‑fibrous plant material. Microwear analysis of the teeth indicates a diet consisting primarily of:\n- Soft to moderately tough foliage such as ferns, cycads, and low‑lying conifer needles.  \n- Possible occasional consumption of seed pods and fruiting structures from early angiosperms that proliferated in the Late Cretaceous.  \nDigestive adaptations likely included a large gut for fermenting plant matter, similar to modern large herbivorous reptiles.\n\n**Paleoenvironment**  \n- **Climate:** Warm, semi‑arid to subtropical conditions with seasonal rainfall. Paleobotanical evidence from the Difunta Group suggests a mosaic of open floodplains, river channels, and pockets of gallery forests.  \n- **Flora:** Dominated by conifers (Cheirolepidiaceae), bennettitaleans, ferns, and a growing diversity of flowering plants (early angiosperms). The presence of large, low‑lying shrubs and herbaceous understory would have provided abundant browse for a low‑browsing ankylosaur.  \n- **Fauna:** Co‑existing dinosaurs include the tyrannosaurid *Lythronax* (apex predator), the hadrosaurid *Kritosaurus*, the ceratopsian *Diabloceratops*, and various small theropods and ornithopods. Crocodylomorphs, turtles, and early mammals also inhabited the area.  \n- **Ecology:** Acantholipan likely lived in small herds or loosely associated groups, using its heavy armor as defense against large theropods. The floodplain setting provided both feeding grounds and safe, vegetated embankments where the animals could rest. Seasonal flooding could have created temporary water bodies, influencing migration patterns and resource availability.\n\n**Summary**  \nAcantholipan was a medium‑sized, heavily armored nodosaurid that roamed the Late Cretaceous floodplains of northern Mexico. Its distinctive spiky armor, low‑browsing herbivorous diet, and adaptation to a warm, semi‑arid environment make it a key taxon for understanding the diversity and biogeography of ankylosaurs in the southern part of the North American continent during the final stages of the dinosaur era.",

    "output": "Acanthopholis (meaning “spiny scale”) is a medium‑sized ankylosaurian dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous, roughly between 130 and 115 million years ago (Barremian to early Aptian stages).  \n\nSize  \nThe animal measured about 4–5 metres (13–16 ft) in length from snout to tail tip. Its height at the hips was close to 1.5 metres (5 ft), and it weighed an estimated 1.5–2 tonnes, a typical build for a heavily armored herbivore of its time.  \n\nFossil locations  \nAll known Acanthopholis material comes from the Wealden Group of southern England, chiefly the Sussex and Kent coasts (the “Atherfield Clay” and “Upper Wealden” formations). A few fragmentary specimens have also been reported from the early Cretaceous deposits of mainland Europe, but these are either indeterminate or have been reassigned to other ankylosaur taxa.  \n\nPhysical description  \nAcanthopholis possessed a low, broad body protected by a dense covering of osteoderms—large, keeled plates that formed a continuous armor over the back and flanks. Along the sides and tail, the plates bore prominent spikes and elongated, pointed tubercles that gave the genus its “spiny” name. The skull was relatively small, with a blunt snout, reduced dentition and a beak suited for cropping vegetation. The limbs were short and stout, ending in broad, hoof‑like feet that supported its massive weight. Unlike later ankylosaurs, Acanthopholis lacked a well‑developed tail club; instead, the distal tail was armed with a series of flexible spikes.  \n\nFossil record  \nThe type species, Acanthopholis horrida, was described in 1865 from a partial skeleton that included several dorsal osteoderms, a fragmentary pelvis, and isolated vertebrae. Subsequent finds have added more osteoderm plates, additional vertebral fragments, and a few isolated limb bones, allowing paleontologists to reconstruct the overall armor layout. The material is relatively fragmentary, and because the Wealden sediments are heavily weathered, complete articulated specimens have never been recovered. Nonetheless, the distinctive spiky osteoderms make the genus readily identifiable in the fossil record.  \n\nDiet  \nAcanthopholis was a herbivore. Its beak and small leaf‑shaped cheek teeth were adapted for cropping low‑lying ferns, cycads, and early angiosperm foliage. The heavy armor suggests it did not need to compete aggressively for food; instead, it likely grazed in groups, browsing the abundant understory vegetation of flood‑plain forests and open woodland.  \n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Barremian‑Aptian of the Wealden Basin, southern England was a humid, subtropical landscape dominated by river deltas, swampy floodplains, and coastal lagoons. The climate was warm and seasonally wet, supporting dense fern thickets, horsetail stands, coniferous trees, and the first scattered flowering plants. Seasonal flooding created a mosaic of wet marshes and drier levees, providing both abundant forage and extensive river channels where large herbivores could migrate. Acanthopholis shared this habitat with contemporaneous dinosaurs such as Iguanodon, small ornithopods, early theropods, and a variety of crocodilian and pterosaur species, as well as abundant freshwater turtles and early mammals. The thick armor of Acanthopholis would have been an effective defense against the predatory theropods that roamed the same flood‑plain ecosystems.",

    "output": "Achelousaurus (Achelousaurus horneri) – Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Length: roughly 5 – 5.5 m (16 – 18 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: about 1.8 m (6 ft).  \n- Estimated body mass: 2 – 3 t (4,400 – 6,600 lb).  \n\nPeriod Range  \n- Late Cretaceous, Campanian stage.  \n- Approximate age: 76 – 73 million years ago (Ma).  \n\nFossil Localities  \n- Primarily recovered from the Two Medicine Formation, north‑central Montana, USA (particularly the “Achelous” quarry near the Blackfeet Indian Reservation).  \n- Additional material has been reported from the Upper Cretaceous strata of the Judith River and from the slightly younger Hell Creek area, but the core record remains in the Two Medicine beds.  \n\nPhysical Description  \nAchelousaurus was a medium‑sized centrosaurine ceratopsian with a robust, low‑slung skull. The most distinctive features are:  \n\n* A short, stout nasal horn that projects forward and upward, much broader than the slender nasal horns of earlier centrosaurines.  \n* A massive, club‑like frill boss covering the central portion of the parietal, studded with a series of low, rounded knobs rather than the long spikes seen in some relatives.  \n* Two pairs of relatively small epiossifications (spike‑like ornaments) positioned on the margin of the frill, one pair near the front corners and a second pair farther back.  \n* A deep, beak‑like rostral bone forming a sharp cutting edge, and a row of robust dental batteries (up to 40 tooth positions per side) for grinding plant material.  \n* The body was built on sturdy, columnar limbs; the forelimbs were slightly shorter than the hindlimbs, giving the animal a low, quadrupedal stance.  \n\nFossil Record  \n- Holotype: FMNH PR 2091, a partial skull with a well‑preserved frill and nasal horn, discovered in 1985.  \n- Referred specimens include at least five additional skulls (e.g., ROM 80380, USNM 495175) and several postcranial partial skeletons, providing a fairly good picture of its anatomy and variation.  \n- The Two Medicine Formation has yielded a relatively dense assemblage of centrosaurine fossils, allowing paleontologists to trace a lineage from earlier forms such as Styracosaurus toward later taxa like Pachyrhinosaurus.  \n- Histological studies on bone tissue indicate rapid growth rates typical of large ceratopsians, reaching adult size in roughly 5–6 years.  \n\nDiet  \nAchelousaurus was a strict herbivore. Its dental batteries and powerful jaw musculature suggest a diet of tough, fibrous vegetation. Likely food sources included:  \n\n* Low‑lying ferns and horsetails that grew in the floodplain understory.  \n* Conifer needles and seed cones from the abundant pine, spruce, and fir trees of the region.  \n* Early flowering plants (angiosperms) such as small shrubs and possibly primitive magnoliids.  \nThe broad, flattened beak would have been used to crop vegetation, while the grinding teeth processed plant material into a mash suitable for digestion.  \n\nEnvironmental Context  \nDuring the Campanian, the Two Medicine Formation represented a coastal plain on the western margin of the Western Interior Seaway. The environment was a mosaic of:  \n\n* River channels and meandering streams that deposited the sandstones and mudstones preserving the fossils.  \n* Flood‑plain mudflats and oxbow lakes that supported lush riparian vegetation.  \n* Open woodlands dominated by conifers, with pockets of fern‑rich understory and scattered angiosperm shrubs.  \n* A semi‑arid climate with seasonal rainfall, leading to periodic droughts and fire events, which created a dynamic landscape of open areas interspersed with forest patches.  \n\nTogether, these conditions provided abundant plant resources for a large herbivore like Achelousaurus, while also offering the type of diverse habitat that supported a rich dinosaur fauna, including hadrosaurs, tyrannosaurids, and smaller theropods.",

    "output": "Acheroraptor (Acheroraptor temertus) – Overview  \n\nSize  \nAcheroraptor was a relatively small dromaeosaurid, comparable in overall length to a modern wolf. Adult individuals measured between 1.5 and 2.0 meters (5–6.5 ft) from snout to tail tip and stood roughly 0.6 m (2 ft) tall at the hip. Body mass is estimated at 15–20 kg (33–44 lb).  \n\nGeological Time Range  \nThe species lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically in the Maastrichtian stage, about 68 to 66 million years ago, just before the end‑Cretaceous mass extinction.  \n\nFossil Localities  \nAll known Acheroraptor material comes from the Hell Creek Formation of North America. Key sites include:  \n\n• The Upper Hell Creek locality near Fort Peck, Montana, where the holotype skull fragment was discovered.  \n• A second, more complete specimen found in the Lance Formation of Wyoming, which yielded additional cranial and post‑cranial bones.  \n\nPhysical Description  \nAcheroraptor possessed the typical dromaeosaurid build: a lightweight, elongated skull with a deep, laterally compressed snout; large, forward‑facing eyes granting stereoscopic vision; and a set of recurved, serrated teeth adapted for slicing flesh. The upper jaw bore 12–14 teeth, the lower jaw slightly fewer. Its forelimbs were relatively long, ending in a partially opposable second digit equipped with a sharp claw. The most distinctive feature was an enlarged, sickle‑shaped claw on the second toe of each foot, used for grasping or slashing prey. The tail was stiffened by elongated caudal vertebrae and a series of ossified tendons, providing balance during rapid maneuvers. Skin impressions, though scarce, suggest a covering of small, non‑overlapping scales interspersed with occasional larger scutes along the dorsal midline.  \n\nFossil Record Details  \nThe holotype (specimen DMNH 20046) consists of a partial skull roof, fragments of the maxilla, and a few vertebrae. It was described in 2009 and established the genus. The second specimen (MOR 1232) includes a more complete skull, portions of the pelvis, and several limb elements, allowing a more precise reconstruction of size and locomotor capabilities. Both specimens show well‑preserved neurovascular canals, indicating a highly developed sense of hearing. No complete skeleton has yet been recovered, but the available material is sufficient to place Acheroraptor within the Velociraptorinae subfamily, closely related to the Asian genus Dromaeosaurus.  \n\nDietary Habits  \nAcheroraptor was a carnivore and likely an opportunistic predator. Its serrated teeth and robust jaw musculature indicate it could tackle a range of prey sizes, from small mammals (multituberculates, early placental mammals) to juvenile or weakened larger dinosaurs such as pachycephalosaurs and ceratopsians. The enlarged pedal claw suggests it may have employed a “grapple‑and‑puncture” hunting method, striking with its foot to immobilize prey before delivering bites. Scavenging on carcasses would also have been possible, especially in the resource‑scarce environments of the latest Cretaceous.  \n\nEnvironmental Context  \nDuring the Maastrichtian, the Hell Creek and Lance formations represented a low‑lying, flood‑plain ecosystem bordering the Western Interior Seaway. The climate was warm and seasonally wet, supporting a mosaic of river channels, oxbow lakes, and dense riparian vegetation composed of ferns, conifers, and early flowering plants. The landscape was dotted with open woodlands and gallery forests, providing ample cover for a small, agile predator like Acheroraptor. Co‑existing fauna included the massive tyrannosaurid Tyrannosaurus rex, hadrosaurid duck‑billed dinosaurs (e.g., Edmontosaurus), ceratopsians (e.g., Triceratops), pachycephalosaurs, as well as a rich assemblage of mammals, turtles, crocodilians, and fish. This diverse community created a dynamic predator‑prey network in which Acheroraptor occupied the niche of a mid‑sized, fast‑moving hunt‑and‑kill specialist, exploiting both terrestrial and near‑water prey.  \n\nIn summary, Acheroraptor was a small, agile dromaeosaurid that roamed the flood‑plains of late‑Cretaceous North America. Its well‑preserved but limited fossil record provides insight into its anatomy, predatory behavior, and the vibrant ecosystems that existed just before the end‑Cretaceous extinction event.",

    "output": "**Achillesaurus** – a mid‑Cretaceous theropod known from fragmentary remains discovered in the northern Andes of Argentina.\n\n**Size**  \nAdult Achillesaurus individuals reached an estimated total length of 6.5‑7.0 meters, with a hip height of about 2.3 meters. The skull measured roughly 75 cm in length, and the animal is thought to have weighed between 900 and 1 200 kilograms.\n\n**Geological age (Period range)**  \nThe rocks in which Achillesaurus fossils occur date to the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Cenomanian to early Turonian stages, approximately 96–93 million years ago. This places the animal among the early radiation of large dromaeosaurid‑like predators in Gondwana.\n\n**Fossil location**  \nAll known material comes from the “Portezuelo de Los Andes” formation, a sedimentary sequence exposed in the Neuquén Basin of western Argentina. The type specimen (specimen MPCA‑2015‑001) was uncovered near the town of San Cayetano in 2015 during a joint Argentine–Spanish paleontological expedition.\n\n**Physical description**  \nAchillesaurus possessed a slender, lightly built body typical of derived paravian theropods, but with several unique adaptations:\n\n* **Skull** – elongated and low‑sloping, with large, forward‑facing orbits suggesting acute binocular vision. The premaxilla bore a pair of enlarged, recurved teeth, while the maxilla carried a series of finely serrated, laterally compressed teeth.\n* **Forelimbs** – relatively long (about 70 % of femur length) and ending in a distinctive “killing claw” on the second digit that was hypertrophied and deeply curved, reminiscent of the famous dromaeosaurid sickle claw. The hand retained a functional opposable thumb with a small claw.\n* **Vertebral column** – the dorsal vertebrae show elongated neural spines that likely supported a sail‑like membrane, providing display or thermoregulatory functions.\n* **Pelvis and hindlimbs** – a robust, slightly opisthopubic pelvis and powerful, cursorial hindlimbs with a 2.1 m long tibia and a metatarsus that was sub‑arctometatarsalian, indicating high running capability.\n* **Tail** – stiffened by elongated caudal vertebrae and ossified tendons, giving the tail a strong, counter‑balancing role during rapid locomotion.\n\n**Fossil record**  \nThe material consists of:\n\n1. A nearly complete skull (missing the posterior braincase).  \n2. Three cervical vertebrae, six dorsal vertebrae, and two sacral vertebrae.  \n3. An associated right hindlimb including femur, tibia, fibula, and a partial foot.  \n4. Two partial left forearms with well‑preserved manus elements.  \n5. Several isolated ribs and a partial pelvis.  \n\nAll specimens were found in close association, suggesting a single individual (likely a sub‑adult) that was rapidly buried in a flood‑plain sand‑stone deposit. No additional specimens have been recovered to date, making Achillesaurus a poorly known but taxonomically distinct genus.\n\n**Diet**  \nThe dentition and claw morphology indicate a carnivorous lifestyle focused on active predation. The recurved premaxillary teeth would have been useful for seizing prey, while the serrated maxillary teeth allowed slicing of flesh. The hypertrophied second‑digit claw, combined with the agile hindlimbs, points to a hunting strategy involving rapid sprints followed by a precise, slashing strike to immobilize small to medium‑sized vertebrates. Likely prey included juvenile sauropods (e.g., *Andesaurus* juveniles), basal ornithopods, and smaller theropods sharing the same habitat. Stomach contents have not been preserved, but micro‑wear patterns on the teeth are consistent with a diet of flesh and occasional bone fragments.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Cenomanian‑Turonian, the Portezuelo de Los Andes region lay on the western margin of the ancient South American continent, adjacent to a broad, low‑lying foreland basin. The sedimentary facies suggest a mosaic of fluvial channels, overbank floodplains, and seasonally inundated lacustrine ponds. Climate reconstructions indicate a warm, semi‑arid to humid regime with pronounced wet seasons, supporting riparian vegetation of ferns, conifers, and early flowering plants. The landscape would have been dotted with scattered coniferous woodlands along riverbanks, open grassy understories, and occasional wetlands that attracted herbivorous dinosaurs. This heterogeneous environment provided ample hunting grounds for a fast, visually oriented predator such as Achillesaurus, allowing it to exploit both open plains for pursuit and denser vegetation for ambush.",

    "output": "Albertosaurus – Overview  \n\nSize  \n• Adult Albertosaurus measured about 9 to 10 metres (30–33 ft) in length.  \n• Height at the hips was roughly 2.5–3 metres (8–10 ft).  \n• Body mass is estimated at 1.8–2.5 tonnes, comparable to a modern adult rhinoceros.  \n\nGeological Time Range  \n• Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage, approximately 76 to 74 million years ago.  \n\nFossil Localities  \n• The majority of known specimens have been recovered from the Belly River Group (also called the Judith River Formation) in southern Alberta, Canada, especially near the town of Milk River and in the Oldman and Horseshoe Canyon formations.  \n• Additional, fragmentary remains have been reported from Montana (USA) and from the Prince Creek Formation of Alaska, suggesting a broader northern distribution in western North America.  \n\nPhysical Description  \n• Albertosaurus was a large theropod belonging to the tyrannosaurid family. It possessed a massive skull with a length of roughly 1.2 metres (4 ft), filled with robust, serrated teeth designed for slicing flesh.  \n• The jaws were relatively slender compared to the later Tyrannosaurus rex, but still capable of delivering a powerful bite.  \n• Its forelimbs were short, ending in two-fingered hands with strong, curved claws.  \n• The hind limbs were muscular and built for rapid, sustained running; the legs end in three-toed feet with large, recurved claws.  \n• The body was covered with small, non‑overlapping scales, and some fossilized skin impressions suggest a possible sparse covering of primitive feather-like filaments on the neck and forelimb region.  \n• The tail was long and stiffened by elongated chevron bones, providing balance during fast locomotion.  \n\nFossil Record and Notable Specimens  \n• The first Albertosaurus material was discovered in 1902 by Barnum Brown; the type species, Albertosaurus sarcophagus, was formally named in 1914.  \n• The most complete and best‑known specimen is the “Albertosaurus “MOR 590” (formerly “MOR 548”), a nearly complete skeleton housed at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta.  \n• Additional near‑complete skeletons, such as “CMN 2139” and “TMP 1993.14.1”, have contributed to detailed reconstructions of its anatomy and growth series.  \n• Histological studies of bone microstructure from multiple specimens have revealed rapid growth rates in juveniles and a relatively short period of sexual maturity, similar to other tyrannosaurids.  \n\nDiet  \n• As a top predator, Albertosaurus was primarily carnivorous, preying on large herbivorous dinosaurs that shared its habitat, such as hadrosaurs (e.g., Saurolophus, Edmontosaurus) and ceratopsians (e.g., Centrosaurus, Chasmosaurus).  \n• Bite‑force simulations indicate a bite strong enough to crush bone, allowing it to consume not only flesh but also marrow‑rich portions of carcasses.  \n• Tooth wear patterns suggest occasional scavenging, and the presence of gut contents in one specimen (a hadrosaur tooth lodged in the throat region) provides direct evidence of active predation.  \n\nEnvironmental Context  \n• Albertosaurus inhabited a warm, humid floodplain ecosystem characterized by extensive river channels, oxbow lakes, and dense vegetation consisting of conifers, ferns, and early flowering plants.  \n• The climate during the Campanian in what is now western Canada was temperate to subtropical, with seasonal rainfall that supported abundant plant growth and a diverse assemblage of herbivorous dinosaurs.  \n• Seasonal flooding created a mosaic of habitats—open woodlands, riparian zones, and swampy lowlands—that offered both hunting grounds and opportunities for ambush.  \n• The presence of large herbivores, smaller theropods, and a variety of ornithischian dinosaurs suggests a complex food web in which Albertosaurus held the apex predator niche.  \n\nIn summary, Albertosaurus was a large, fast‑running tyrannosaurid that roamed the flood‑plains of Late Cretaceous western North America. Its robust skull, powerful bite, and streamlined body made it an effective hunter of the abundant herbivorous dinosaurs of its time, while its fossil record, centered in Alberta’s Belly River Group, provides some of the most complete insights into the biology and ecology of early tyrannosaurids.",

    "output": "Alectrosaurus (Alectrosaurus olseni) is a medium‑sized theropod dinosaur known from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia.  \n\nSize – The animal is estimated to have measured about 5 to 6 metres (16–20 ft) in total length, with a body mass in the range of 500–800 kg. Its hind limbs were long and powerful, while the forelimbs were relatively short but proportionally longer than those of later tyrannosaurids.  \n\nPeriod – Fossils date to the Cenomanian‑Turonian interval, roughly 95 to 90 million years ago, placing Alectrosaurus in the early part of the Late Cretaceous.  \n\nFossil location – All confirmed material comes from the Bayan Shireh Formation of central Mongolia, a sedimentary sequence that preserves a rich assemblage of Cretaceous vertebrates.  \n\nPhysical description – The known bones show a gracile, lightly built skeleton. The vertebrae are moderately pneumatic, indicating a fairly lightweight torso. The femur and tibia are robust, suggesting strong running ability. The hand retained three functional digits with sharp, recurved claws. Teeth, known only from fragmentary dentaries, were laterally compressed and serrated, typical of a carnivorous diet. The skull, though not recovered, is inferred to have been relatively narrow compared with later, bulkier tyrannosaurids.  \n\nFossil record – Alectrosaurus is represented by a handful of fragmentary specimens: a partial dorsal vertebral series, isolated caudal vertebrae, a left femur, a tibia, and a few fore‑limb elements (including a partial radius and manual phalanges). These were collected during Soviet‑Mongolian fieldwork in the late 1960s and described by Halszka Osmólska in 1970. No complete skeleton has yet been found, and the genus is known only from these isolated bones, which have been re‑examined several times to clarify its phylogenetic position among basal tyrannosauroids.  \n\nDiet – As a theropod with serrated teeth, Alectrosaurus was a carnivore. Its size and limb proportions suggest it hunted medium‑sized prey such as juvenile hadrosaurids, small ceratopsians, and possibly smaller ornithopods. The relatively long forelimbs may have been used to grasp struggling prey or to assist in manipulating carcasses.  \n\nEnvironment – The Bayan Shireh Formation records a semi‑arid floodplain with meandering rivers, seasonal lakes, and patches of coniferous and early angiosperm vegetation. The climate was likely warm with marked seasonal variation, producing periods of drought interspersed with wetter intervals that supported lush riverbanks. Alectrosaurus shared its habitat with a diverse dinosaur fauna that included the large hadrosaur Saurolophus, the ceratopsian Protoceratops, small dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor, and various herbivorous ankylosaurs. The mosaic of open floodplains, wooded riparian zones, and occasional dune fields would have offered both hunting grounds and cover for this agile predator.  ",

    "output": "Alioramus – a medium‑sized tyrannosaurid from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia  \n\n**Size**  \nAdult individuals are estimated to have reached a total length of about 5–6 metres (16–20 ft) and a body mass in the range of 300–500 kg. The skull was relatively long and low‑set, measuring roughly 60 cm in length, and the limbs were proportionally slender compared with the much bulkier later tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus rex.  \n\n**Geological period**  \nAlioramus lived during the upper Campanian to early Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous, roughly 71–66 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil localities**  \nAll known specimens come from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. The first material (the holotype of *Alioramus mongoliensis*) was recovered from the Nemegt Formation near the Flaming Cliffs (Bayanzag). A second, more complete specimen (designated *Alioramus altaiensis*) was found in the Upper Cretaceous Nemegt‑type sediments of the Altai Mountains. Both sites represent fluvial‑depositional environments within the larger Nemegt basin.  \n\n**Physical description**  \n- **Skull:** Long, narrow, and low; the premaxilla and maxilla are elongated, giving the animal a “snout‑like” appearance. The skull bears a series of small, finely serrated teeth (up to 14 tooth positions in the maxilla, considerably more than in other tyrannosaurids).  \n- **Crest:** Several specimens preserve a thin, low ridge or keel running down the mid‑line of the dorsal surface of the skull, a feature not seen in more basal tyrannosaurids.  \n- **Post‑cranial skeleton:** The vertebral column is relatively gracile, with elongated cervical vertebrae that support the long neck. The forelimbs are proportionally longer than in later tyrannosaurids, ending in three functional digits with sharply curved claws. Hindlimbs are strong and built for fast, sustained running.  \n- **Body covering:** Skin impressions are unknown, but based on related tyrannosaurids, it likely possessed a scaly integument with possible small osteoderms along the dorsal midline.  \n\n**Fossil record**  \nOnly a handful of fragmentary specimens have been recovered, but they are relatively well‑preserved. The holotype (specimen AL211) consists of a partial skull, a few cervical vertebrae, and portions of the forelimb. The Altai specimen (IGM 100/979) includes a nearly complete skull, a partial braincase, and much of the post‑cranial skeleton, providing the most complete view of the anatomy to date. No juvenile or embryonic material has yet been found, but the presence of multiple individuals of different sizes suggests a modestly sized local population.  \n\n**Diet**  \nThe numerous small, finely serrated teeth and the slender, elongated jaws indicate a feeding strategy focused on relatively small prey. Alioramus likely hunted small ornithischians, juvenile sauropods, early birds, and possibly large insects or small reptiles. Its long, flexible neck and relatively light build would have aided rapid strikes and a “snap‑and‑hold” technique rather than the crushing bite seen in later, more massive tyrannosaurids. Some paleontologists also propose an opportunistic scavenging habit, feeding on carcasses left by larger predators.  \n\n**Environment**  \nAlioramus inhabited the lush floodplains and meandering river systems of the Nemegt region. The sedimentology points to a warm, semi‑arid climate with seasonal rainfall that produced extensive river channels, oxbow lakes, and vegetated floodplain forests. Plant life was dominated by conifers, ginkgos, and early flowering plants, providing a diverse herbivore community (hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurs) that would have served as prey. The area also supported a rich assemblage of smaller vertebrates—pterosaurs, early mammals, and lizards—creating a complex ecosystem in which a swift, mid‑sized predator like Alioramus could thrive.  \n\nIn summary, *Alioramus* represents a distinct, more gracile branch of tyrannosaurid evolution, adapted to a hunting niche focused on small, fast prey within the verdant, river‑filled landscapes of Late Cretaceous Mongolia.",

    "output": "Allosaurus – General Overview\n\nSize  \nAdult Allosaurus individuals ranged from about 8 to 12 metres (26 to 40 feet) in total length. The largest specimens approached 12 metres, while more typical adults were around 8.5 metres long. Height at the hip was roughly 3 metres (10 feet), and the animal weighed an estimated 2 to 3 tonnes, comparable to a modern African buffalo.\n\nPeriod Range  \nAllosaurus lived during the Late Jurassic epoch, roughly between 155 and 145 million years ago. Its temporal range is confined mainly to the Kimmeridgian and Tithonian stages of the Jurassic.\n\nFossil Locations  \nThe most abundant and well‑studied Allosaurus material comes from North America, especially the Morrison Formation of the western United States (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Oklahoma). Additional fossils have been recovered from the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania (East Africa) and isolated teeth and bones from the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal. These sites provide geographic evidence that Allosaurus had a broad, albeit primarily Laurasian, distribution.\n\nPhysical Description  \nAllosaurus was a large, bipedal theropod with a skull that was about 85 centimetres long, heavily built yet relatively lightly constructed compared to later tyrannosaurids. The skull featured a pronounced bony ridge above each eye, giving the animal a formidable “horned” appearance. Its jaws were lined with dozens of sharp, serrated teeth, each about 5–7 centimetres in length, ideal for slicing flesh. The forelimbs were relatively long for a theropod, ending in three-fingered hands with robust claws up to 10 centimetres long. The torso was deep and muscular, supported by a strong tail that acted as a counter‑balance. Body surface coverings likely included a combination of primitive feather-like filaments on the forearms and neck, and larger, more scale‑like coverings elsewhere.\n\nFossil Record Highlights  \n- The type specimen, *Allosaurus fragilis* (CM 333), discovered in 1877 near Garden Park, Colorado, includes an almost complete skeleton.  \n- The “Morrison Monster” (UCSC 001) from Utah provides a near‑complete skull and articulated post‑cranial elements, giving insight into cranial mechanics.  \n- The “Allosaurus specimen ‘Big Al’” (BMRP2002.4.1) from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry, Utah, is notable for its pathologic injuries, showing healed fractures that illustrate the animal’s ability to survive serious trauma.  \n- African material from the Tendaguru beds includes several partial skeletons and isolated teeth, confirming that the genus was not limited to North America.  \n\nDiet and Feeding Behavior  \nAllosaurus was a carnivore and an apex predator in its ecosystems. Its serrated teeth and powerful bite suggest a diet primarily composed of large herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs, camarasaurid sauropods, and ornithopods. Bite‑force estimates indicate a relatively modest bite compared with later tyrannosaurids, implying that Allosaurus may have employed a hunting strategy that relied on repeated slashing bites and using its forelimbs to grip or dismember prey. Evidence of healed injuries on prey fossils, as well as tooth marks on dinosaur bones, supports the idea that it could both hunt live animals and scavenge, taking advantage of carrion when available.\n\nEnvironmental Context  \nDuring the Late Jurassic, the regions where Allosaurus fossils are found were part of a vast floodplain system under a semi‑arid climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Formation represents a mix of river channels, lakes, and expansive low‑lying plains covered with conifer‑dominated forests, ferns, and cycads. Seasonal monsoonal rains would have created temporary wetlands and abundant vegetation, supporting a rich assemblage of herbivorous dinosaurs, early mammals, crocodilians, and turtles. In the African Tendaguru region, similar fluvial environments existed, with a more tropical influence and diverse plant life including horsetails and giant cycads. These habitats offered ample hunting grounds for a large, active predator such as Allosaurus, which would have roamed open plains as well as forested riverbanks in pursuit of prey.",

    "output": "Alvarezsaurus – General Overview  \n\n**Taxonomy**: Theropoda → Coelurosauria → Alvarezsauroidea  \n**Species**: *Alvarezsaurus calvoi* (the type and only species)  \n\n**Size**  \n- Total length: roughly 2 – 2.2 m (6½ – 7 ft).  \n- Hip height: about 0.8 m (2.6 ft).  \n- Estimated body mass: 20 – 30 kg (44 – 66 lb).  \n\n**Geological Time Range**  \n- Late Cretaceous, specifically the Turonian to Coniacian stages.  \n- Approximate age: 86 – 83 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- All known material comes from north‑western Argentina, from the Neuquén Province.  \n- The primary site is the Portezuelo Formation (part of the Neuquén Group) near the Rio Limay basin.  \n- Additional fragmentary remains have been reported from the underlying Cerro Lisandro and the overlying Cerro Lafón members, confirming a relatively narrow geographic distribution within the Patagonian fore‑arc basin.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n- **Skull**: Small, narrow, with reduced dentition; the teeth are conical, laterally compressed and few in number, suggesting a diet of soft‑bodied prey.  \n- **Neck and torso**: Lightly built, with a short, stiffened neck and a torso that tapers toward the hips, giving the animal a streamlined silhouette.  \n- **Forelimbs**: Highly reduced but specialized; each forelimb ends in a single, enlarged claw on the second digit, while the other digits are vestigial. The forearm bones are robust, indicating strong musculature for digging or tearing.  \n- **Hind limbs**: Long and slender, built for rapid running; the tibia is longer than the femur, and the foot shows a well‑developed arctometatarsalian arrangement (the central metatarsal is pinched between the adjacent ones).  \n- **Tail**: Long, stiffened by elongated chevrons and ossified tendons, serving as a counter‑balance during fast locomotion.  \n- **Plumage**: No direct skin or feather impressions are known, but as a coelurosaur it is inferred to have borne simple filamentous feathers, at least on the forearms and tail.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- The holotype (PVL 4599) consists of a partial skeleton: cervical and dorsal vertebrae, ribs, a partial pelvis, both hind limbs, and fragments of the forelimb including the distinctive enlarged claw.  \n- Additional referred specimens (e.g., PVL 4617, MCF‑PV 281) supply more complete hind‑limb elements and further vertebral material, allowing reconstruction of the full skeletal proportions.  \n- Preservation is generally good, with articulated elements indicating rapid burial in fluvial sandstones. No complete skull has yet been recovered, leaving some cranial details uncertain.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- The reduced dentition and the presence of the powerful digging claw suggest a primary diet of insects (especially ants and termites) and other small invertebrates.  \n- Occasionally, it may have captured small vertebrates (lizards, early mammals) or scavenged carrion, but the anatomy is optimized for probing into nests or burrows rather than for active predation on larger prey.  \n\n**Environmental Context**  \n- The Portezuelo Formation records a semi‑arid floodplain environment with seasonal river systems.  \n- Paleosols indicate alternating wet and dry periods, supporting a mosaic of vegetation: coniferous trees, ginkgo‑like plants, ferns, and low‑lying shrubs.  \n- The climate was warm temperate, with mean annual temperatures estimated around 20–25 °C (68–77 °F) and moderate precipitation concentrated in summer months.  \n- The ecosystem harboured a diverse fauna: large tyrannosaur‑like abelisaurids (*Abelisaurus*), titanosaur sauropods (*Pitekunsaurus*), ornithopods, crocodilians, and abundant small vertebrates, providing ample ecological niches for a specialized insectivore like *Alvarezsaurus*.  \n\nIn summary, *Alvarezsaurus* was a modest‑sized, fast‑running theropod of the Late Cretaceous Patagonian floodplains, uniquely adapted for a digging, insect‑eating lifestyle, and known from a modest yet informative set of fossils that illuminate its anatomy, ecology, and the environment it once inhabited.",

    "output": "Amargasaurus (Amargasaurus cazaui) was a medium‑sized sauropod that lived during the Early Cretaceous, roughly between 130 and 125 million years ago, in what is now the north‑western region of Argentina.  \n\nSize  \nAdult individuals are estimated to have reached lengths of about 15 meters (≈50 feet) and a shoulder height of roughly 4 meters (≈13 feet). Their mass is thought to have been in the range of 10–12 tonnes, comparable to a modern elephant.  \n\nGeological period  \nThe species is confined to the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous, a time when South America was part of the southern super‑continent Gondwana and the climate was becoming increasingly warm and semi‑arid.  \n\nFossil locations  \nAll known specimens have been recovered from the La Amarga Formation in the Neuquén Province of Patagonia, Argentina. The type locality is near the town of Plaza Huincul, where a relatively complete series of vertebrae, ribs, parts of the pelvis and a partial skull were discovered in the 1980s.  \n\nPhysical description  \nAmargasaurus possessed the classic long neck and tail of dicraeosaurid sauropods, but it is most famous for a pair of tall, narrow neural spines that ran along the mid‑line of its neck and anterior back. These spines could reach up to two meters in height and were likely covered with a sheath of keratin, giving the animal a sail‑like appearance. The neck was relatively short for a sauropod, composed of only 12–13 cervical vertebrae, and the torso was stout, with a broad ribcage. Its limbs were robust, ending in columnar feet with blunt claws. The skull, though fragmentary, suggests a relatively small head with a beak‑like snout and leaf‑shaped teeth suited for cropping vegetation.  \n\nFossil record  \nThe holotype (specimen MPCA‑S-1440) includes a series of 13 cervical vertebrae bearing the characteristic elongated spines, several dorsal vertebrae, ribs, a partial pelvis, and a few limb elements. Additional material, such as isolated caudal vertebrae and isolated teeth, has been referred to Amargasaurus from nearby sites within the same formation, confirming a modest but well‑preserved record for a South American dicraeosaurid. No complete skeleton has yet been found, but the existing elements are sufficient to reconstruct most of the animal’s anatomy with confidence.  \n\nDiet  \nLike other sauropods, Amargasaurus was an herbivore. Its leaf‑shaped, slightly spatulate teeth indicate a feeding strategy focused on stripping foliage from low‑ to mid‑height plants. The relatively short neck suggests it fed primarily at heights of 1–3 meters above the ground, browsing on conifers, cycads, ferns, and the early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to appear in the Early Cretaceous. The heavy, muscular neck and the possible sail of spines may have helped regulate body temperature while the animal processed large quantities of fibrous plant material.  \n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Barremian, the La Amarga Formation represented a flood‑plain ecosystem with a mix of braided rivers, seasonal lakes and open vegetated plains. The climate was warm with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Vegetation was dominated by conifer‑dominated woodlands, tall ferns, seed ferns (pteridosperms), and scattered early angiosperms. The landscape also supported a diverse fauna, including other sauropods (such as Futalognkosaurus), early titanosaurs, theropods like the large carnivorous Abelisaurids, and various ornithischians. Periodic volcanic ash falls contributed to the rapid burial of skeletal remains, which is why the La Amarga Formation preserves such clear impressions of Amargasaurus’s vertebral spines. The overall setting was a semi‑arid, open environment with abundant water sources along the river channels, providing ample forage for large herbivores such as Amargasaurus.",

    "output": "Ammosaurus (meaning “sand lizard”) is a poorly known basal sauropod that lived during the Late Jurassic. Its remains were first discovered in the Morrison Formation of the western United States and have been interpreted as representing a distinct, though fragmentary, genus that may be closely related to early members of the Camarasauridae.\n\n**Size**  \n- Estimated total length: 12–14 meters (40–46 feet).  \n- Height at the hip: about 3.5 meters (11.5 feet).  \n- Body mass: roughly 7–9 tonnes, based on limb‑bone scaling.\n\n**Period range**  \n- Late Jurassic, specifically the Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian stages, about 155–150 million years ago.\n\n**Fossil locations**  \n- Morrison Formation, western Colorado (Eagle County) and Utah (Grand County).  \n- The type specimen comes from the Brushy Basin Member, a silty‑to‑sand‑rich layer that preserves many other large herbivores.  \n- Additional isolated teeth and vertebral fragments have been reported from the same formation in Wyoming and New Mexico, extending the known geographic range of the genus.\n\n**Physical description**  \n- A medium‑sized sauropod with a relatively robust, columnar forelimb and a slightly longer, more flexible hindlimb.  \n- Neck composed of 12–13 relatively short cervical vertebrae, giving it a moderately elevated feeding height compared with more derived diplodocids.  \n- Vertebral neural arches bear low, rounded laminae and modestly developed dorsal spines, indicating a sturdy but not overly elongated trunk.  \n- Teeth are spatulate to leaf‑shaped, with coarse denticles along the margins, suited for cropping vegetation rather than slicing.  \n- The forefeet bear five weight‑bearing digits, the inner three bearing broad, rounded pads, a condition typical of early sauropods.  \n- Tail is moderately long, ending in a tapered tip with a series of small osteoderms that may have served a defensive role.\n\n**Fossil record**  \n- Holotype: UMNH VP 18600, a partial postcranial skeleton consisting of a right humerus, a series of dorsal vertebrae, several caudal vertebrae, and portions of the pelvis.  \n- Paratypes: isolated teeth (USNM 12345), a left femur (BYU 9101), and a partial sacrum (UCM 5678).  \n- All specimens are fragmentary; no complete skull has been recovered, limiting precise taxonomic placement.  \n- The material is well preserved in fine‑grained sandstones, allowing detailed micro‑structural analysis of bone histology, which shows rapid early growth rates typical of sauropods.\n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous, feeding on low‑ to mid‑height vegetation. The spatulate teeth suggest a diet of ferns, cycads, and coniferous foliage rather than high‑canopy conifers.  \n- Bite marks on associated plant fossils indicate that Ammosaurus stripped foliage rather than crushing tough seed cones.  \n- Gut‑capacity estimates, based on body mass, imply a fermentative digestive system capable of processing large quantities of fibrous plant material.\n\n**Environmental description**  \n- Lived in the flood‑plain environments of the Morrison Formation, a semi‑arid landscape punctuated by seasonal rivers, lakes, and oxbow lakes.  \n- The Brushy Basin Member records alternating mud‑stone and sand‑stone layers, indicating periodic flooding followed by dry periods.  \n- Vegetation comprised extensive fern and cycad thickets along river margins, with coniferous woods on slightly higher ground.  \n- Climate was warm temperate with marked seasonal precipitation, supporting a diverse megafaunal community that included other sauropods (e.g., Camarasaurus, Diplodocus), stegosaurs, and early theropods.  \n- The sandy substrate of the depositional environment likely gave the dinosaur its name, reflecting the “sand lizard” habitat in which it roamed.",

    "output": "Ampelosaurus – General Overview  \n\nAmpelosaurus is a medium‑large titanosaurian sauropod that lived in what is now southern France during the latest part of the Cretaceous period. It is one of the best‑known European titanosaurs and provides a vivid picture of the fauna that inhabited the western European archipelago at the end of the Mesozoic.\n\nSize  \n‑ Length: about 12–14 metres (40–46 ft) from snout to tip of the tail.  \n‑ Height at the hip: roughly 3.5 metres (11.5 ft).  \n‑ Estimated body mass: 8–10 tonnes (17,600–22,000 lb).  \n\nPeriod Range  \nAmpelosaurus lived between approximately 84 million and 72 million years ago, spanning the Campanian to the early Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous.\n\nFossil Localities  \nThe material assigned to Ampelosaurus comes chiefly from the “Marnes Rouges” (Red Marls) of the Bouches‑du‑Rhône and Alpes‑Maritimes departments in southeastern France. Key sites include:  \n\n* The type locality near Aix‑en‑Provence, especially the “Marnes Rouges de Saint‑Martin‑de‑Londres”.  \n* The “Couches de Saint‑Joséph” near Le Muy.  \n* Additional isolated remains have been reported from the “Grès à Reptiles” of the nearby Vaucluse region and a few fragmentary specimens from the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) that may belong to the same genus.  \n\nPhysical Description  \nAmpelosaurus possessed the classic titanosaur body plan: a relatively short, robust neck; a massive, barrel‑shaped torso; and a long, tapering tail. Its skull was small, low, and poorly known, but the dentition consisted of peg‑like, leaf‑shaped teeth suited for cropping vegetation. The forelimbs were shorter than the hind limbs, giving the animal a slightly “hunched” stance compared with earlier sauropods.  \n\nA distinctive feature of Ampelosaurus is the presence of dermal armor: dozens of rounded osteoderms (bony plates) are known from the dorsal series, arranged in rows along the back and flanks. These plates were relatively thin‑walled and probably provided protection against theropod predators. The limb bones are heavily pneumatised (filled with air spaces), a typical sauropod adaptation that reduced weight while maintaining strength.  \n\nFossil Record and History of Discovery  \nThe first definitive specimens were unearthed in the early 1990s during quarrying operations in the red marls of southern France. The holotype (MNHN.F.44948) includes a partial postcranial skeleton with vertebrae, limb elements, and a series of osteoderms. Since then, more than a dozen additional individuals have been recovered, ranging from isolated vertebrae and teeth to near‑complete articulated skeletons.  \n\nBecause the material is often found in fluvial channel deposits, many fossils are preserved in a disarticulated but tightly associated state, allowing paleontologists to reconstruct the overall anatomy with reasonable confidence. The abundance of dermal armor in the assemblage makes Ampelosaurus one of the few titanosaurs for which we have a clear picture of sauropod osteoderm morphology.  \n\nDietary Interpretation  \nAmpelosaurus was a strict herbivore. Its modestly shaped, spatulate teeth indicate a feeding strategy based on stripping foliage rather than grinding it. In the Late Cretaceous of southern France the available plant groups included:  \n\n* Coniferous trees (such as members of the Araucariaceae and Cupressaceae).  \n* Cycads and bennettitaleans, which formed dense understoreys.  \n* Early angiosperms (flowering plants) that had begun to diversify, especially low‑lying shrubs and small trees.  \n\nThe animal most likely fed at mid‑height, using its long neck to browse a range of vegetation from ground level up to about 3 metres high. The presence of osteoderms does not directly affect diet but may have allowed Ampelosaurus to spend longer periods in open floodplain settings where predator pressure was higher.  \n\nEnvironmental Setting  \nDuring the Campanian‑Maastrichtian, the region that is now Provence was part of an extensive coastal plain dotted with river channels, lagoons, and low‑lying flood‑deposits. Climate was warm and seasonally humid, with a pronounced wet season that supported lush vegetation. The sedimentary facies (red marls and sandstones) indicate deposition in a meandering river system with periodic overbank flooding, creating a mosaic of wet meadows, riparian woodlands, and patches of open scrub.  \n\nThe ecosystem hosted a diverse assemblage of dinosaurs:  \n\n* Small theropods such as *Rhabdodon* and possible dromaeosaurids.  \n* Ankylosaurian armor‑plated dinosaurs (e.g., *Polacanthus*‑like forms).  \n* Hadrosauriforms and other ornithopods that grazed the same floodplains.  \n\nInvertebrates, fish, and early mammals also inhabited the waterways and leaf litter, contributing to a complex food web. The presence of abundant plant material and water sources would have made the area an ideal grazing ground for a large herbivore like Ampelosaurus, while the osteoderms offered a defensive advantage against the occasional predatory theropod that prowled the same habitats.  \n\nIn summary, Ampelosaurus was a 12‑metre‑long, armored titanosaur that roamed the warm, river‑dominated landscapes of Late Cretaceous southern France, feeding on a variety of coniferous and early flowering plants and leaving behind a rich fossil record that has illuminated both its biology and the environment it inhabited.",

    "output": "Amygdalodon  \nSize: Estimated total length about 12–15 metres (40–50 ft) and a mass in the range of 7–10 tonnes. The animal was a medium‑sized sauropod, roughly the size of a modern bus, with a long neck and relatively robust limbs.  \n\nGeological period: Early to middle Middle Jurassic, specifically the Bajocian‑Bathonian stages (≈ 170–166 million years ago).  \n\nFossil localities: All known material comes from the Cañadón Asfalto Formation in the Chubut Province of Patagonia, Argentina. The type specimen was collected near the town of Las Violetas, close to the Cerro Bayo locality, and additional isolated bones have been reported from nearby outcrops of the same formation.  \n\nPhysical description: Amygdalodon is a basal sauropod that retained several primitive features. The skull is unknown, but the neck vertebrae are elongated, possessing low neural spines and ventrally placed keels that give the name “amygdal” (almond‑shaped). The dorsal vertebrae are massive and have deep pleurocoels (air‑filled cavities). The scapula is broad and thick‑set, indicating strong forelimb musculature. Limb bones are robust and columnar, suggesting a weight‑bearing gait. The tail is relatively short compared to later sauropods, ending in a set of caudal vertebrae that are fused into a stiff rod. Overall the animal had a low, barrel‑shaped torso, a relatively short tail, and a neck capable of raising the head several metres above the ground.  \n\nFossil record: The holotype (MPEF-PV 1155) includes a series of cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a partial scapulocoracoid, several ribs, and fragmentary limb elements. Subsequent finds have added isolated caudal vertebrae, additional dorsal vertebrae, and a few chevron pieces. The material is fairly complete for a basal sauropod, allowing researchers to evaluate its anatomy and place it near the base of the Sauropoda tree, just before the radiation of the more derived diplodocoid and macronarian groups. No cranial material has yet been recovered.  \n\nDiet: Like all sauropods, Amygdalodon was an obligate herbivore. Its long neck would have permitted a wide feeding envelope, allowing it to browse low‑lying ferns and cycads as well as higher coniferous foliage. The teeth of related early sauropods are spoon‑shaped and low‑crowned, suggesting a diet of soft to moderately tough plant material rather than the high‑fibrous foliage tackled by later, more derived sauropods.  \n\nEnvironment: The Cañadón Asfalto Formation represents a fluvial‑lacustrine setting that was influenced by volcanic activity. During the Middle Jurassic Patagonia was a warm temperate region with seasonal rainfall. River floodplains and shallow lakes were interspersed with forested patches dominated by conifers (Araucariaceae), bennettitaleans, ferns, and seed ferns. Occasional volcanic ash layers indicate periodic eruptions that contributed to the rapid burial of carcasses, helping preserve the Amygdalodon skeletons. The ecosystem would have supported a range of other vertebrates, including early theropods, small ornithischians, and abundant freshwater fish, providing a complex food web in which Amygdalodon acted as a large primary consumer.",

    "output": "**Anchiceratops** – a large, late‑Cretaceous ceratopsian from North America  \n\n**Size**  \nAnchiceratops was a robust quadruped measuring about 5.5–6.5 metres (18–21 ft) in total length from snout to tail. Its shoulder height reached roughly 2 metres (6.5 ft) and it is estimated to have weighed between 2 and 3 tonnes, comparable in bulk to a modern bull.\n\n**Geological period**  \nThe species lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian to early Maastrichtian stages, about 72 to 71 million years ago. This places it among the last‑standing members of the ceratopsid lineage before the end‑Cretaceous extinction.\n\n**Fossil localities**  \nAll confirmed Anchiceratops material comes from the western interior of Canada, primarily the Dinosaur Park Formation and the older Oldman Formation of southern Alberta. The most famous specimens were uncovered near the town of Dinosaur Provincial Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site renowned for its dense concentration of Cretaceous fossils.\n\n**Physical description**  \nAnchiceratops possessed the classic ceratopsian body plan: a broad, quadrupedal torso, a large nasal horn, and a massive bony frill extending from the back of the skull. Its frill was relatively narrow and elongated, bearing a series of modest, bead‑like epoccipital spikes along the margin rather than the dramatic spikes seen in some relatives. The nasal horn was short and stout, while a low pair of brow horns curved slightly forward. The beaked mouth was adapted for cropping vegetation, and the cheek teeth were arranged in a complex dental battery capable of grinding tough plant material. The overall skull length reached about 1.5 metres, giving the animal a distinctive, high‑profile silhouette.\n\n**Fossil record**  \nThe genus is known from a handful of fairly complete skulls and several partial postcranial elements. The holotype (specimen NMC 8547) consists of a nearly complete skull with portions of the braincase. Additional notable finds include specimens LACM 12012 and ROM 856, both providing well‑preserved frill fragments. Postcranial material is scarce; isolated limb bones and vertebrae have been referred to Anchiceratops based on matching size and stratigraphic occurrence, but a fully articulated skeleton has yet to be discovered.\n\n**Diet**  \nAnchiceratops was a strict herbivore. Its dental battery, comprising hundreds of tightly packed ridged teeth, allowed it to process fibrous, low‑lying vegetation. In the flood‑plain ecosystems of the Dinosaur Park Formation, probable food sources included ferns, horsetails, low conifers, and the leaves of flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to diversify. The beak would have been used to bite off foliage, while the grinding teeth broke down plant cell walls.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the late Campanian, the region that is now southern Alberta was a warm, humid coastal plain bordering the Western Interior Seaway. The landscape featured a mosaic of river channels, flood‑plain meadows, and forested patches dominated by conifers, cycads, and early angiosperms. Seasonal rains created abundant water sources and lush vegetation, supporting a diverse dinosaur community that included hadrosaurs, tyrannosaurids, and other ceratopsians. Anchiceratops likely preferred the open flood‑plain areas where grasses and low shrubs grew, using its size and frill for defense and possibly for visual display within herds.",

    "output": "**Anchiornis huxleyi – Overview**  \n\n**Size**  \n- Body length: about 0.5 m (≈ 50 cm) from snout to tip of the tail.  \n- Hip height: roughly 15 cm.  \n- Estimated mass: 0.2–0.3 kg (a bit heavier than a modern pigeon).  \n\n**Geologic Age (Period Range)**  \n- Late Jurassic, Oxfordian–Kimmeridgian stages.  \n- Approximate age: 160 – 161 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- All known specimens come from the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning Province, northeastern China.  \n- The primary discovery site is the “Dapeng” (also called “Dapenglu”) locality near the town of Lingyuan, though additional material has been recovered from nearby beds at the Yixian and Haifanggou deposits, which are laterally equivalent to the Tiaojishan.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n\n*Skeleton*  \n- Small, lightly built theropod with a long, bony tail that makes up about half the total length.  \n- Forelimbs are proportionally long, reaching nearly the length of the hind limbs; the manus bears a reduced but functional set of three digits, the outer two bearing large, asymmetrical feathers.  \n- Hind limbs are slender with long tibiae; the second toe lacks a large sickle claw, distinguishing it from later dromaeosaurids.  \n\n*Feather Cover*  \n- Four‑winged condition: long pennaceous feathers on both the forearms and the distal portions of the legs (the “hind wings”).  \n- Body plumage consists of downy contour feathers covering the neck, torso and thighs.  \n- Microscopic analysis of melanosomes shows a patterned coloration: a dark (black) dorsal surface with a contrasting light (white‑gray) ventral region, plus a distinctive “banded” pattern on the forearms and legs, suggesting a form of counter‑shading and possible display signals.  \n\n*Skull*  \n- Small, triangular skull with large orbits indicating good vision.  \n- Teeth are small, recurved, and serrated, but far fewer in number than in typical non‑feathered theropods, hinting at a diet of soft prey.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- The holotype (specimen IVPP V 13352) was described by Xu et al. in 2009 and consists of a nearly complete, articulated skeleton preserved in fine volcanic ash.  \n- Additional specimens (e.g., IVPP V 12765, BMNH 2015.2, and several “paratypes” housed at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing) provide a range of ontogenetic stages from juvenile to sub‑adult.  \n- All fossils are preserved as three‑dimensional impressions rather than flattened slabs, allowing detailed reconstruction of limb posture and feather attachment.  \n- The exceptional preservation of melanosomes in several specimens has made Anchiornis a key taxon for studies of dinosaur coloration.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- Tooth morphology and wear patterns suggest a diet primarily of small, soft‑bodied prey: insects, arachnids, and perhaps small lizards or early mammals.  \n- The relatively weak jaw muscles and lack of large cutting teeth indicate it was not a predator of large vertebrates.  \n- Some researchers propose opportunistic omnivory, including consumption of seeds or fleshy plant parts, as a supplement when animal prey was scarce.  \n\n**Paleoenvironment**  \n\n*Landscape*  \n- The Tiaojishan Formation records a volcanically active, lacustrine (lake‑dominated) setting.  \n- The area consisted of a mosaic of conifer‑dominated forests, ginkgo‑like trees, cycads, and fern understories, interspersed with open water bodies and marshy margins.  \n\n*Climate*  \n- Warm temperate to subtropical climate with pronounced seasonal variation.  \n- High levels of atmospheric oxygen and relatively low CO₂ compared with modern levels, supporting abundant plant growth and a diverse arthropod fauna.  \n\n*Community*  \n- Anchiornis shared its habitat with other feathered theropods (e.g., Epidexipteryx, Eomaia), early mammals (e.g., *Yanoconodon*), basal pterosaurs, and a rich assemblage of amphibians, fish, and invertebrates.  \n- The presence of abundant volcanic ash layers contributed to rapid burial, which explains the exceptional preservation of soft tissues and feathers.  \n\n**Summary**  \nAnchiornis huxleyi was a tiny, four‑winged, feathered theropod living about 160 million years ago in the forest‑lake ecosystems of what is now northeastern China. Its size, anatomy, and plumage place it near the base of the paravian lineage that gave rise to birds, while its diet of insects and small vertebrates and its forested, volcanically active environment illustrate the ecological niche occupied by early feathered dinosaurs during the Late Jurassic.",

    "output": "**Anchisaurus – Overview**\n\n**Size**  \n- Adult length: about 2 – 2.5 metres (6.5 – 8 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 0.7 metres (2.3 ft).  \n- Estimated mass: 30 – 45 kg (66 – 99 lb).  \n\n**Geological Time Span**  \n- Lived during the Late Triassic to the Early Jurassic, roughly 199 – 183 million years ago (Norian to Hettangian stages).  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- Primary discoveries are from the Upper Triassic–Lower Jurassic strata of the Connecticut River Valley, USA (particularly the East Windsor and Portland formations of Connecticut).  \n- Additional, more fragmentary material has been reported from New Jersey (the Newark Supergroup) and from the Jurassic of Nova Scotia, Canada.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n- Small, lightly built sauropodomorph with a long neck composed of 10–12 elongated cervical vertebrae, giving it a “giraffe‑like” neck compared to its short body.  \n- Forelimbs were slightly longer than the hind limbs; the hand possessed five digits, the outer three bearing robust, curved claws useful for grasping vegetation.  \n- The tail was relatively short and stiff, acting as a counter‑balance for the neck.  \n- Skull was narrow and low, with large, forward‑facing eyes; teeth were leaf‑shaped, slightly serrated, and arranged in a continuous row, indicating adaptation for cropping plants.  \n- Body covered in small, simple filamentous structures (possible proto‑feathers) inferred from related early sauropodomorphs, though no direct skin impressions are known for Anchisaurus.  \n\n**Fossil Record & Specimens**  \n- The holotype (AMNH 460) is a partial skeleton comprising most of the vertebral column, portions of the pelvis, and several limb bones, discovered in 1855 near East Windsor, Connecticut, and described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877.  \n- Additional specimens (e.g., USNM 2225, YPM 617) include more complete skull material and articulated forelimbs, providing insight into cranial anatomy and feeding mechanics.  \n- Over 30 catalogued specimens exist in North American museum collections, making Anchoraurus one of the best‑known early sauropodomorphs.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous; dentition and jaw mechanics indicate a primarily leaf‑browsing diet, feeding on low‑lying ferns, cycads, and early conifers.  \n- The relatively low bite force and finely serrated teeth suggest it could process softer foliage rather than tough, woody material.  \n\n**Paleoenvironment**  \n- Lived in a warm, humid climate with pronounced seasonal rainfall, typical of the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic rift valleys of eastern North America.  \n- The sedimentary deposits where its fossils are found represent floodplain environments with meandering rivers, overbank mudstones, and interbedded sandstones.  \n- Vegetation consisted of dense fern thickets, horsetail stands, and scattered coniferous trees, providing abundant food and shelter.  \n- The ecosystem also hosted early dinosaurs (e.g., Coelophysis), basal archosaurs, amphibians, and a diverse assemblage of insects, indicating a complex, multi‑tiered food web.  \n\n**Summary**  \nAnchisaurus was a modest‑sized, early sauropodomorph that walked on all fours, using its long neck to reach vegetation in the lush floodplain forests of the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic of eastern North America. Its well‑preserved fossil material has made it a key taxon for understanding the early evolution of the lineage that would later give rise to the giant, long‑necked sauropods of the Jurassic and Cretaceous.",

    "output": "Ankylosaurus  \nSize: Adult individuals reached lengths of about 6–8 meters (20–26 feet) from snout to tail, stood roughly 1.7–2 meters (5.5–6.5 feet) tall at the hips, and weighed an estimated 4–8 tonnes.  \n\nPeriod range: Lived during the Late Cretaceous, approximately 73 to 66 million years ago, in the Maastrichtian stage, just before the end‑Cretaceous extinction event.  \n\nFossil locations: The most complete and well‑known specimens have been recovered from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana (USA) and the Lance Formation of Wyoming. Additional fragmentary remains and isolated armor plates have been found in the Judith River and Two Medicine formations (also in Montana) and in occasional sites in Canada (Alberta).  \n\nPhysical description: Ankylosaurus possessed a low, broad, heavily armored body. Its skull was short and triangular, shielded by thick bony plates (osteoderms) that fused into a continuous carapace covering the neck, back, and flanks. The tail ended in a massive bony club formed by several enlarged osteoderms fused together, capable of delivering powerful blows. The limbs were short, stout, and columnar, supporting its great weight, while the forelimbs bore large, curved claws that may have helped in digging for vegetation. The animal’s muzzle was beak‑like, and its teeth were small, leaf‑shaped, and suited for grinding plant material.  \n\nFossil record: The first Ankylosaurus fossils were described by Barnum Brown in 1908. Since then, more than a dozen relatively complete skeletons have been recovered, providing detailed information on its armor arrangement, tail club morphology, and stance. The Hell Creek specimens preserve articulated vertebrae, ribs, and nearly complete armor plates, allowing paleontologists to reconstruct the animal’s musculature and posture with high confidence. Isolated osteoderms and tail club fragments have been found across a wide area of the Western Interior, confirming that Ankylosaurus was a common component of the late‑Cretaceous megafauna.  \n\nDiet: A strict herbivore, Ankylosaurus fed on low‑lying vegetation. Its beak could clip ferns, cycads, and the tough leaves of conifers, while its dental batteries ground plant matter. The animal likely grazed near riverbanks and floodplains where soft, nutrient‑rich foliage was abundant, possibly supplementing its diet with occasional shrubs or young cycads.  \n\nEnvironment: Ankylosaurus inhabited the coastal plain and flood‑plain ecosystems of what is now the north‑central United States during the Maastrichtian. The climate was warm and relatively humid, with seasonal rain that supported extensive forests of conifers, ginkgos, and flowering plants, interspersed with open wetlands, river channels, and lakes. The landscape was a mosaic of dense vegetation and open ground, providing both ample food and hiding places. Large predators such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Dakotaraptor roamed the same habitats, making Ankylosaurus’s heavy armor and defensive tail club essential for survival in this predator‑rich environment.",

    "output": "Anserimimus Overview  \n-------------------  \n\n**Size** – Adult individuals are estimated to have been about 2.5–3.0 metres (8–10 ft) in total length, with a body mass roughly 70–90 kg (150–200 lb).  \n\n**Geological period** – Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage, about 83 to 72 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil locations** – All known material comes from the Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert in southern Mongolia, near the town of Nemegt. The type specimen (IGM 100/1013) and additional finds were recovered from the “Bayanshiree” locality and nearby sites within the same formation.  \n\n**Physical description** –  \n- Skull: long, low, and lightly built with a beak‑like, edentulous rostrum that gives the genus its name (“duck‑mimic”).  \n- Teeth: small, conical teeth are present only in the posterior part of the jaws, indicating a reduced dentition compared to typical theropods.  \n- Limbs: fore‑arms are slender and end in three‑fingered hands with uncinate claws; the hind limbs are long and powerful, with a tibia longer than the femur, suggesting a fast, cursorial gait.  \n- Tail: relatively stiffened by elongated chevrons, aiding balance during rapid running.  \n- Plumage: while no direct skin impressions have been found, phylogenetic inference from closely related ornithomimids suggests a covering of simple feather filaments.  \n\n**Fossil record** – The primary specimen consists of a nearly complete skull, partial vertebral column, pelvis, and both fore‑ and hind‑limbs, allowing a reasonably detailed reconstruction. Additional isolated elements (e.g., metatarsals, dorsal vertebrae) have been assigned to Anserimimus from the same stratigraphic horizon, confirming the presence of a modest population in the Nemegt ecosystem. No cranial ornaments or crest are known, and the preservation quality is sufficient to study bone microstructure, which indicates rapid growth rates typical of small theropods.  \n\n**Diet** – The reduced dentition and beak‑like snout point toward a primarily omnivorous diet. Likely food items include:  \n- Small vertebrates (lizards, early mammals, juvenile dinosaurs) captured opportunistically.  \n- Invertebrates such as beetles, ants, and other arthropods.  \n- Plant material – seeds, fruits, and possibly low‑lying vegetation, which could be processed with the beak and the few posterior teeth.  \nStable‑isotope analyses of related ornithomimids support a flexible trophic niche, and Anserimimus is presumed to have occupied a similar opportunistic feeding strategy.  \n\n**Environmental context** – The Nemegt Formation during the Campanian was a relatively humid, fluvial landscape, contrasting with the more arid settings of earlier Mongolian formations. Features included:  \n- Meandering river channels with floodplains and occasional oxbow lakes.  \n- Lush riparian vegetation dominated by conifers, ginkgos, and flowering plants, providing both food sources and cover.  \n- A diverse vertebrate fauna: large theropods (e.g., Tarbosaurus), large herbivores (e.g., Saurolophus, Pinacosaurus), crocodilians, turtles, and abundant fish and amphibians.  \n- Seasonal climate variations with wet summers promoting lush growth and drier winters, creating a dynamic ecosystem where a fast, adaptable runner like Anserimimus could exploit a wide range of resources.  \n\nIn summary, Anserimimus was a medium‑sized, agile ornithomimid from Late Cretaceous Mongolia, adapted for rapid locomotion and a versatile diet, thriving in the river‑dominated, vegetated habitats of the Nemegt Formation.",

    "output": "**Antarctosaurus – Overview**  \n\n**Size**  \nAntarctosaurus was a very large titanosaurian sauropod. Most estimates place the animal at 20–30 metres (65–100 ft) in total length, with a body mass ranging from roughly 30 to 45 tonnes (66,000–99,000 lb). The most robust specimens, such as those referred to *A. giganteus*, may have approached the upper end of this range, while the type species (*A. wichmannianus*) is thought to be slightly smaller, around 22 m (72 ft) long.\n\n**Geological period**  \nThe genus lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically in the Campanian to Maastrichtian ages (approximately 83.6 – 66 million years ago). The fossil-bearing strata in which it is found are dated to this interval, making Antarctosaurus one of the last surviving giant sauropods of South America.\n\n**Fossil localities**  \nAll confirmed Antarctosaurus material comes from Argentina, principally from the Neuquén Province in the southern Andes. Key sites include:  \n\n- The Anacleto and Portezuelo Formations of the Neuquén Group (Mendoza and Neuquén provinces).  \n- The Rio Negro Province (specimens assigned to *A. septentrionalis*).  \n\nA few fragmentary remains have also been reported from Brazil and Uruguay, but these are generally considered dubious or referable only to indeterminate titanosaurs.\n\n**Physical description**  \nAntarctosaurus possessed the classic sauropod body plan: a small, box‑shaped skull with relatively simple, leaf‑shaped teeth; an enormously long neck composed of at least fifteen cervical vertebrae; a massive, barrel‑shaped torso; and a long, muscular tail that ended in a thickened “whiplash” tip.  \n\nThe limbs were columnar and robust, especially the femur and humerus, which are among the few bones recovered. The femur of *A. wichmannianus* measures about 2.2 m (7.2 ft) in length, indicating great weight‑bearing capacity. The vertebrae display the typical titanosaurian features of wide, deep neural arches and pneumatic (air‑filled) chambers, which helped reduce the overall mass of the animal while preserving strength. Some specimens show evidence of ossified skin plates (osteoderms) along the flanks, a trait seen in several other titanosaurs, though preservation is limited.\n\n**Fossil record**  \nThe genus is known from a relatively sparse but diagnostic collection of bones:  \n\n- Dorsal and sacral vertebrae (including the type specimen of *A. wichmannianus*).  \n- Partial limb elements: a left femur, a right humerus, and fragments of the pelvis.  \n- Isolated teeth and a few rib fragments.  \n\nBecause most material is fragmentary, the exact number of valid species is debated. *A. wichmannianus* (type) and *A. giganteus* are the best‑supported, while *A. septentrionalis* and *A. boliviensis* are often regarded as nomina dubia or misassigned.\n\n**Diet**  \nAs a sauropod, Antarctosaurus was an obligate herbivore. Its teeth were spoon‑shaped and only lightly worn, suggesting a diet of soft to moderately tough vegetation. In the Late Cretaceous of Patagonia, the primary food sources would have included:  \n\n- Coniferous foliage (e.g., Araucariaceae).  \n- Ferns and horsetails in floodplain margins.  \n- Early angiosperms such as primitive flowering shrubs and low‑lying trees.  \n\nThe length of the neck indicates that individuals could browse at multiple heights, from low‑lying ferns to high conifer crowns, allowing them to exploit a broad ecological niche and reduce competition with smaller herbivores.\n\n**Environment**  \nAntarctosaurus inhabited the western margin of the ancient South American continent, a region that during the Campanian–Maastrichtian was characterized by a mosaic of environments:  \n\n- **Fluvial floodplains**: Meandering rivers deposited sandstones and mudstones (the Anacleto Formation), creating fertile soils that supported abundant vegetation.  \n- **Coastal lowlands**: Proximity to the proto‑South Atlantic led to occasional marine influences, with occasional tidal flats and lagoonal settings.  \n- **Semi‑arid steppe patches**: Seasonal rainfall produced periods of drought, favoring drought‑tolerant plants such as certain conifers and xerophytic ferns.  \n\nThe climate was generally warm temperate, with mild winters and a pronounced wet season. This combination of water‑rich floodplains and drier upland areas provided a diverse plant community, supporting large herbivores like Antarctosaurus as well as a variety of theropod predators, ankylosaurs, and smaller ornithischians.  \n\nOverall, Antarctosaurus represents one of the most massive terrestrial animals that ever walked South America, thriving in a dynamic, richly vegetated landscape just before the final extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous.",

    "output": "Apatosaurus – Overview  \nSize: Adults reached lengths of 21–22 meters (70–73 feet) and stood about 4–5 meters (13–16 feet) tall at the hips. Mass estimates range from 18 to 30 tonnes, making it one of the largest terrestrial herbivores of its time.  \n\nGeological period: Late Jurassic, roughly 155 to 145 million years ago, primarily within the Tithonian stage.  \n\nFossil locations: The majority of well‑preserved material comes from the Morrison Formation of the western United States, especially in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico and Montana. Additional fragmentary remains have been reported from the Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania, though those are generally assigned to closely related diplodocids rather than true Apatosaurus specimens.  \n\nPhysical description: Apatosaurus was a massive, quadrupedal sauropod with a long, whip‑like tail and a relatively short, robust neck compared with its close relatives (e.g., Diplodocus). The neck comprised about 12 vertebrae, each massive and reinforced with complex pneumatic chambers that reduced weight while maintaining strength. The skull was small, elongated, and low‑set, bearing leaf‑shaped teeth arranged in a simple, spatulate row suited for stripping foliage. Its limbs were columnar; the forelimbs were slightly shorter than the hind limbs, giving the animal a gentle upward‑sloping back profile. The torso was deep and barrel‑shaped, supporting a massive gut needed for fermenting plant material. Skin impressions are rare, but related diplodocids suggest a covering of small, polygonal scales rather than large osteoderms.  \n\nFossil record: Since the first discovery in the late 19th century (the type specimen YPM 1912 from the Como Bluff quarry, Wyoming), over a dozen relatively complete skeletons have been unearthed, including several articulated series of vertebrae and limb bones. The most complete specimens are the “Apatosaurus louisae” skeletons from the Carnegie Museum (CM 352) and the “Apatosaurus ajax” material from the Utah Museum of Natural History. These specimens provide detailed information on vertebral morphology, limb proportions, and growth patterns, allowing paleontologists to reconstruct life‑size models with high confidence.  \n\nDiet: Apatosaurus was a high‑browsing herbivore, feeding primarily on coniferous foliage, cycads, and ginkgophytes that grew in the canopy of Jurassic forested floodplains. The spatulate teeth were efficient at stripping soft foliage but not at grinding; therefore, the animal relied on a massive, fermenting gut (similar to modern ruminants) to break down cellulose. Stable‑isotope analyses of bone collagen indicate a diet dominated by C3 plants, consistent with the prevalence of gymnosperms in its environment.  \n\nEnvironment: During the Late Jurassic, the Morrison Formation represented a semi‑arid to seasonally wet floodplain ecosystem, dotted with river channels, oxbow lakes, and expansive vegetation belts. The climate was warm with distinct wet and dry seasons. Forests were dominated by tall conifers (e.g., Araucaria, Sequoia), podocarps, and understory ferns, providing abundant food for large herbivores. Apex predators such as Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus and large crocodylomorphs roamed the same habitats, while smaller dinosaurs, pterosaurs and early mammals filled other ecological niches. The presence of abundant water sources and lush vegetation supported the enormous energy demands of Apatosaurus and allowed massive herds to migrate across the floodplains in search of fresh browse.",

    "output": "Aquilops americanus – Overview  \n\nSize:  \nAquilops was a small, lightly built dinosaur, measuring roughly 1.2–1.5 metres (4–5 ft) in total length. Body mass estimates place it at about 15–20 kilograms (33–44 lb), similar in size to a modern medium‑sized dog.  \n\nPeriod range:  \nThe species lived during the Early Cretaceous, specifically the late Aptian stage, about 113 to 108 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations:  \nAll known specimens come from the Cedar Mountain Formation in eastern Utah, United States, most notably the Yellow Cat Member near the town of Green River. The holotype (UMNH VP 12704) was recovered in 1999, and additional partial skulls and jaw fragments have been found in the same horizon.  \n\nPhysical description:  \nAquilops was a basal ceratopsian, retaining many primitive features. It possessed a modest, parrot‑like beak at the front of the jaws but lacked the large facial horns and extensive frill seen in later ceratopsids. The skull was low and relatively elongate, with a short, deep braincase and a small, low ridge where a frill would later develop. Its limbs were proportionally long, indicating a primarily bipedal stance, though the hind‑feet were sturdy enough for occasional quadrupedal support. The tail was moderately long and likely used for balance. Skin impressions are unknown, but related early ceratopsians suggest a covering of simple, non‑ornamented scales.  \n\nFossil records:  \n- Holotype skull fragment (partial braincase, premaxilla, and maxilla) – UMNH VP 12704.  \n- Additional cranial elements (partial jugal, dentary fragments) from the same stratigraphic level.  \n- No post‑cranial skeletons have been recovered, so limb proportions are inferred from close relatives such as Psittacosaurus.  \nThe material is relatively well preserved, allowing detailed study of the braincase and dental arrangement, which confirm Aquilops as one of the earliest known North‑American ceratopsians.  \n\nDiet description:  \nAquilops was an herbivore. Its keratinous beak and cheek teeth were suited for cropping low‑lying vegetation. Dental wear patterns indicate shearing of relatively soft plant material: ferns, horsetails, and the leaves of early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to diversify, as well as cycads and coniferous needles. The lack of strong chewing surfaces suggests it processed food only briefly before swallowing.  \n\nEnvironmental context:  \nDuring the late Aptian, the Cedar Mountain region was a warm, semi‑arid floodplain intersected by meandering rivers and occasional lakes. The climate featured seasonal rainfall, supporting a mosaic of riparian woodlands, open fern‑ and horsetail‑dominated understories, and scattered conifer stands. Periodic volcanism contributed ash deposits that helped preserve the fossil beds. This setting provided abundant low vegetation for a small herbivore like Aquilops, while also supporting a diverse fauna of early ankylosaurs, ornithopods, and small theropods that would have been potential predators or competitors.

    "output": "**Aragosaurus** – a modest‑sized sauropod that roamed the Iberian Peninsula during the early Cretaceous.\n\n**Size**  \n- Length: roughly 12‑14 metres (40‑46 ft).  \n- Height at the shoulder: about 4 metres (13 ft).  \n- Estimated mass: 6‑8 tonnes.\n\n**Geological period**  \n- Early Cretaceous, Aptian‑Albian stages.  \n- Approximate age: 130 – 115 million years ago.\n\n**Fossil locality**  \n- First material recovered from the Galve and Utrillas Formations in the provinces of Teruel and Zaragoza, northeastern Spain (Aragon region).  \n- The type specimen was collected near the town of Galve (Teruel) in 1995 and later additional bones were found at the “Los Monges” site close to Zaragoza.\n\n**Physical description**  \nAragosaurus possessed the classic body plan of a mid‑Cretaceous titanosauriform: a relatively long, columnar neck supporting a small, box‑shaped skull; a robust, barrel‑shaped torso; and a muscular, tapering tail. The vertebrae show modestly expanded neural arches and lightly pneumatic chambers, indicating a well‑vascularised bone structure that helped keep the skeleton light. The forelimbs are shorter than the hindlimbs but still sturdy enough to bear the animal’s weight, and the hands end in a broad, five‑digit manus with a dominant thumb claw used for pulling vegetation. Skin impressions are unknown, but related sauropods suggest a covering of coarse, pebble‑like ossicles embedded in a thin keratinous layer.\n\n**Fossil record**  \n- The holotype consists of an isolated anterior dorsal vertebra (specimen “GAL‑01”).  \n- Additional referred material includes two caudal vertebrae, a partial left femur, and several isolated ribs.  \n- No skull material has been recovered to date.  \n- The bones are preserved in fine‑grained sandstone, allowing detailed study of the internal pneumatic chambers and growth rings, which suggest that individuals reached skeletal maturity at about 20 years of age.\n\n**Diet**  \n- Strictly herbivorous.  \n- Dental wear facets and the low, leaf‑shearing bite implied by the jaw morphology of close relatives indicate a diet of high‑browsing foliage: coniferous needles, cycads, bennettitaleans and, increasingly, early angiosperm leaves.  \n- The long neck would have allowed Aragosaurus to sweep a wide feeding envelope, from ground‑level ferns to canopy‑level gymnosperm shoots.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Aptian‑Albian the area that is now Aragon was a low‑lying floodplain punctuated by meandering rivers and occasional oxbow lakes. Climate was warm and semi‑arid, with seasonal rains that created lush riparian strips along watercourses. Vegetation consisted of mixed coniferous forests (Araucariaceae, Cheirolepidiaceae), abundant ferns, horsetails, and the first wave of flowering plants (early eudicots). The ecosystem also hosted iguanodontian ornithopods, small coelurosaurian theropods, and early crocodylomorphs, making it a dynamic but relatively open landscape where large herbivores like Aragosaurus could move freely between feeding grounds.",

    "output": "Aralosaurus – General Overview  \nSize: Estimated adult length about 6 – 7 meters (20–23 ft) and a shoulder height of roughly 2 meters (6.5 ft); body mass around 1.5 – 2 tonnes.  \n\nGeological time range: Late Cretaceous, specifically the Cenomanian–Turonian interval, roughly 94 to 89 million years ago.  \n\nFossil localities: All known material comes from the Bostobe (also called Bostobyn) Formation on the northern margin of the ancient Aral Sea in present‑day Kazakhstan (near the villages of Shakh Shakh and the Aral Sea coast). The genus name “Aralosaurus” literally means “Aral Sea lizard”.  \n\nPhysical description:  \n- Skull: Only a partial skull is known, but it includes a robust maxilla bearing a distinctive, raised tubercle that formed the base of a small, hollow nasal crest. The crest is low and not as elaborate as later lambeosaurines.  \n- Dentition: Typical hadrosaurid dental batteries with hundreds of tightly packed replacement teeth, indicating a powerful grinding apparatus.  \n- Post‑cranial skeleton: Fragmentary ribs, vertebrae and limb elements suggest a gracile, bipedal‑quadrupedal animal capable of both walking on two legs at speed and supporting its weight on all fours while feeding. The forelimbs are relatively short but robust, with a hand bearing five digits, the first reduced to a thumb spike.  \n- Skin & integument: No direct skin impressions are known, but by analogy with other hadrosaurids it likely possessed scaly skin with possible patches of simple filamentous “feathers” along the tail and limbs.  \n\nFossil record notes:  \n- The holotype (PIN 3142/251) consists of a partial skull roof, a maxilla with the crest tubercle, several teeth, and isolated post‑cranial fragments.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated teeth and vertebral fragments that corroborate the presence of a hadrosaurid population in the same beds.  \n- To date only a single species, *Aralosaurus tuberiferus*, has been confirmed. No complete skeleton has been recovered, so most reconstructions rely on closely related basal lambeosaurines such as *Probactrosaurus* and *Jinzhousaurus*.  \n\nDiet: Like all hadrosaurids, *Aralosaurus* was a strict herbivore. The extensive dental battery allowed it to process tough, fibrous vegetation. Microwear studies on the teeth (from the limited material) indicate a mixed feeding strategy: cropping low‑lying ferns, horsetails, and coniferous needles while also being capable of browsing higher foliage when necessary.  \n\nPaleo‑environment:  \nThe Bostobe Formation records a coastal plain dominated by river channels, flood‑plains, and shallow lacustrine ponds that drained into the western margin of the proto‑Tethys Sea. The climate was warm and semi‑arid with seasonal precipitation, supporting a mosaic of plant communities: riparian conifers, ginkgoes, bennettitaleans, ferns, and abundant horsetail stands. The same strata have yielded other vertebrates such as the nodosaurid *Turanosaurus*, the ankylosaur *Tarbosaurus?* (actually a tyrannosaurid), pterosaurs, and early fish, indicating a diverse ecosystem where *Aralosaurus* likely moved in small herds, browsing both near water sources and on the drier upland areas.  \n\nIn summary, *Aralosaurus* was a medium‑sized, herbivorous hadrosaurid from the Cenomanian‑Turonian of Kazakhstan, distinguished by a modest nasal crest and a well‑developed tooth battery, living in a warm, river‑dominated coastal landscape that bordered the ancient Aral Sea.",

    "output": "**Archaeoceratops – Overview**\n\n**Size**  \n- Adult length: roughly 1.5–2.0 metres (5–6.5 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: about 0.8 m (2.6 ft).  \n- Body mass: estimated 200–300 kg (440–660 lb), comparable to a modern large goat or small pony.  \n\n**Geological Time Span**  \n- Lived during the Early Cretaceous, specifically the Aptian to Albian stages, about 125 to 100 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- First described from the Xinjiang Province of north‑western China, in the Hekou Group (also referred to as the Hami or Tugulu Group).  \n- Additional material has been recovered from the same basin and from nearby Early Cretaceous formations such as the Bayinbuluk and the Qigu Formation, all within the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang.  \n- No definitive finds outside this region have been confirmed, making Archaeoceratops an endemic Asian taxon.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n- A small, bipedal‑quadrupedal herbivore with a compact, low‑slung body.  \n- Skull: short, deep, and roughly 15 cm long, bearing a modest frill at the rear of the skull. The frill was relatively simple, lacking the elaborate spikes or hooks seen in later ceratopsians.  \n- Horns: a pair of modest, pointed nasal horns above the nose and a small pair of brow horns above the eyes. Both sets were short (a few centimeters) and likely covered with keratinous sheaths.  \n- Dentition: leaf‑shaped marginal teeth with coarse denticulation, suited for cropping vegetation; a battery of cheek teeth arranged in rows for grinding.  \n- Limbs: forelimbs relatively short but robust, ending in five‑fingered hands with strong manual claws; hind limbs longer, ending in three‑toed feet. The pelvis was broad, supporting a sturdy stance for low browsing.  \n- Body covering: evidence from related basal ceratopsians suggests a coat of primitive filamentous feathers or simple proto‑feathers, especially along the tail and forelimbs, though direct fossil skin impressions are lacking.  \n\n**Fossil Record and Specimens**  \n- The holotype (IVPP V11127) consists of a partial skull, including the rostral, premaxillae, and a fragmentary frill, together with associated jaw fragments.  \n- Referred material includes several isolated skull elements (e.g., jugals, quadrates) and a handful of post‑cranial bones (partial vertebral column, limb fragments).  \n- The specimens are relatively well preserved, allowing detailed study of cranial ornamentation and dental wear patterns, but complete skeletons have not yet been discovered.  \n- Stratigraphic work places the fossils consistently within fluvial sandstones and overbank mudstones, indicating rapid burial by river‑related sediments.  \n\n**Diet and Feeding Adaptations**  \n- Herbivorous, feeding primarily on low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and early angiosperm leaves.  \n- The beak‑like rostral bone formed a sharp, parrot‑like snout useful for cropping plants close to the ground.  \n- Cheek teeth formed a grinding surface, with wear facets indicating a shearing‑and‑crushing motion suited to tough, fibrous plant material.  \n- Likely employed a “chewing cycle” similar to later ceratopsians, moving the lower jaw forward and backward while the cheeks retained food, allowing efficient breakdown of foliage.  \n\n**Paleoenvironment**  \n- Archaeoceratops inhabited a warm, semi‑arid floodplain ecosystem within the Junggar Basin.  \n- Climate: seasonal precipitation with distinct wet and dry periods; mean annual temperatures estimated around 20–25 °C (68–77 °F).  \n- Landscape: meandering rivers and braided streams creating oxbow lakes and expansive flood‑plain mudflats; interspersed with sand dunes and occasional volcanic ash layers.  \n- Vegetation: dominated by river‑margin forests of conifers (e.g., Araucariaceae), ginkgoes, and understory ferns; the emergence of early flowering plants (angiosperms) added new food sources.  \n- Faunal community: coexisted with other early ceratopsians, small theropods (e.g., early tyrannosauroids), herbivorous ornithopods, and various crocodyliforms. Invertebrates such as freshwater bivalves and insects were abundant, supporting a complex food web.  \n- The sedimentary context suggests that individuals may have lived in small herds, taking advantage of seasonal vegetation flushes and using the river system for migration and water access.  \n\n**Summary**  \nArchaeoceratops represents one of the earliest members of the Ceratopsia, a modestly sized, lightly armored herbivore that inhabited Early Cretaceous floodplains of what is today north‑western China. Its modest frill and small horns foreshadow the spectacular headgear of later ceratopsids, while its dental and skeletal adaptations reveal a diet of low‑lying, tough vegetation within a warm, seasonally wet environment. The relatively complete cranial material provides valuable insight into the early evolutionary steps that led to the iconic horned dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous.",

    "output": "Archaeopteryn (often referred to as Archaeopteryx) is a small, feathered theropod that lived at the very end of the Jurassic period and is considered a transitional form between non‑avian dinosaurs and modern birds.\n\nSize  \n- Adult individuals measured about 50 cm (20 in) from the tip of the snout to the tip of the tail, with a wingspan of roughly 60 cm (24 in).  \n- Body mass is estimated at 0.8–1 kg (1.8–2.2 lb), comparable to a modern pigeon.\n\nPeriod range  \n- Lived during the late Jurassic, approximately 150 to 148 million years ago, in the Tithonian stage.\n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens come from the Solnhofen limestone of southern Germany, a Lagerstätte famous for its exceptionally fine preservation.  \n- To date, about a dozen reasonably complete fossils and several fragmentary pieces have been recovered from the Solnhofen Plattenkalk deposits.\n\nPhysical description  \n- The skeleton combines primitive dinosaurian traits (a long bony tail, toothed jaws, clawed fingers on the hand, and a pelvis similar to that of small theropods) with avian features (asymmetrical flight feathers on the fore‑limbs, a furcula or wishbone, and a partially reversed hallux).  \n- Feathers are preserved as impressions; the primary wing feathers are long and narrow, while a covering of downy plumage covered the body and legs.  \n- The skull is relatively large, with a beak at the tip but still retaining sharp teeth along the jaws.  \n- The hind limbs end in a partially reversed first toe that could aid in perching, though the claw was not as developed as in modern perching birds.  \n- The tail is bony and feathered, ending in a fan of long rectrices that may have helped with stability in flight.\n\nFossil record  \n- The first specimen, “London Specimen,” was described in 1861 and sparked the debate over the origin of birds.  \n- Subsequent finds include the “Berlin Specimen,” the most complete skeleton with articulated feathers, and the “Solnhofen Specimen,” which preserves exquisite feather detail.  \n- The Solnhofen limestone’s lagoonal environment, with rapid burial in fine carbonate mud, has left impressions of soft tissues rarely seen in other dinosaur fossils, providing key evidence of feather structure, arrangement and even coloration patterns in some specimens.\n\nDiet description  \n- Tooth morphology and wear patterns indicate a carnivorous/insectivorous diet.  \n- Likely prey included small vertebrates such as lizards, early mammals, and other small dinosaurs, as well as large insects and arachnids.  \n- The combination of a grasping hand, sharp teeth, and agile flight would have allowed it to snatch prey from the air or pluck it from vegetation and the ground.\n\nEnvironmental description  \n- Archaeopteryx lived in a warm, tropical archipelago that covered much of what is now southern Germany.  \n- The Solnhofen region represented a shallow, protected lagoon dotted with islands and surrounded by carbonate platforms.  \n- The lagoon water was calm and slightly brackish, with a mixture of microbial mats, algae, and occasional marine fauna.  \n- The surrounding area likely featured coastal forests of conifers, cycads, and ginkgo‑type plants, providing perching sites and a rich insect fauna.  \n- Periodic storms and rapid sediment influx from nearby land contributed to the fine limestone that preserved the fossils, while also creating a dynamic habitat where small, agile animals like Archaeopteryx could exploit both terrestrial and aerial niches.",

    "output": "Archaeornithomimus is a relatively small, fast‑running theropod that lived in the Late Cretaceous of what is now East Asia.  \n\n**Size** – The animal measured roughly 2.5 to 3 metres (8–10 ft) in length from snout to tail tip and stood about 1 metre (3 ft) tall at the hips. Body mass has been estimated at around 40–60 kg, comparable to a modern large turkey or small deer.  \n\n**Period range** – Its remains are dated to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 83 to 72 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil locations** – The only known specimens have been recovered from the Nemegt and Barun Goyot formations of Mongolia, specifically near the town of Övörkhangai. Additional isolated teeth and foot elements attributed to the genus have been reported from the Iren Dabasu Group in Inner Mongolia, China.  \n\n**Physical description** – Archaeornithomimus possessed a slender, gracile skeleton with long, powerful hind limbs built for speed. The forelimbs were relatively short but ended in three‑fingered hands with sharp, recurved claws. Its skull was lightly built, elongated, and tooth‑less, bearing a beak‑like keratinous covering reminiscent of modern ostriches. The neck was long and flexible, supporting a small, pointed snout. The tail was stiffened by elongated rod‑like vertebrae, providing balance during rapid locomotion. Feather impressions are not known from the specimens, but related ornithomimids are believed to have been covered in a plumage of simple filamentous feathers, so a similar covering is plausible.  \n\n**Fossil record** – The type species, *Archaeornithomimus asiaticus*, was named in 1996 based on a partial skeleton that includes portions of the skull, vertebral column, pelvis, and both hind limbs. The holotype (MPC-D 100/702) is housed at the Mongolian Paleontological Center. Subsequent discoveries have added isolated metatarsals, pedal phalanges, and a few isolated teeth that confirm the taxonomic placement within Ornithomimidae. The preservation quality is moderate; the bones retain some surface texture that reveals muscle attachment sites, but no soft‑tissue impressions have been recovered.  \n\n**Diet** – The beak‑like jaws and complete lack of teeth indicate a diet that did not involve heavy chewing. Most researchers interpret Archaeornithomimus as an omnivore or opportunistic herbivore, feeding on soft plant material such as leaves, seeds, and possibly coniferous cones, while also supplementing its intake with small invertebrates, insects, and possibly small vertebrates caught on the move. The morphology of its forelimbs and claws suggests it could have used them to dig for roots or pry open fruit.  \n\n**Environment** – During the Campanian, the Nemegt and Barun Goyot formations represented a mosaic of semi‑arid floodplains, river channels, and occasional forested patches. The climate was warm with seasonal rainfall, supporting a mix of coniferous and angiosperm vegetation, riverine reeds, and low‑lying shrubs. Large herbivorous dinosaurs such as *Saurolophus* and *Therizinosaurus* roamed the same habitats, while predators like *Tarbosaurus* and *Velociraptor* hunted nearby. In this setting, Archaeornithomimus would have acted as a fleet‑footed forager, capable of quickly covering ground to graze on abundant low‑lying vegetation and to escape larger carnivores. Its slender build and possible feather covering would have helped regulate body temperature in the variable temperatures of the Cretaceous steppe‑forest ecotone.",

    "output": "Argentinosaurus – Overview  \n\nSize: Argentinosaurus is one of the largest known land animals. Estimates based on the recovered vertebrae and limb bones suggest a length of 30 to 35 metres (98–115 ft) and a standing height of about 7 metres (23 ft) at the shoulder. Mass estimates range from 70 to 100 tonnes, comparable to the weight of several African elephants combined.  \n\nGeological Period: This giant lived during the Late Cretaceous, roughly between 97 and 94 million years ago, in the Cenomanian–Turonian interval.  \n\nFossil Localities: The only confirmed specimens have been recovered from the Neuquén Province of north‑western Argentina, specifically from the upper Río Limay Formation (also called the \"Candeleros Formation\") and associated deposits of the Huincul Group. The type material was discovered near the town of Plottier and near the site known as \"Villa El Chocón\".  \n\nPhysical Description: Argentinosaurus belonged to the titanosaurian branch of sauropods. Its body was a massive, columnar support system of thick, gravi‑proportionate limbs ending in broad, weight‑bearing feet. The neck was extremely long, composed of at least 15 cervical vertebrae that allowed the animal to sweep a wide feeding envelope. The tail was equally robust, ending in a tapering, possibly muscular tip. The vertebrae display the characteristic \"pneumatic\" air‑filled chambers that reduced skeletal weight without sacrificing strength. Skin impressions are unknown, but related titanosaurs suggest a covering of small, pebble‑like osteoderms scattered across the back and flanks.  \n\nFossil Record: Only fragmentary remains have been recovered, the most diagnostic being several dorsal and caudal vertebrae, a couple of dorsal ribs, and portions of the humerus and femur. These bones are unusually large even among titanosaurs, and the convex, opisthocoelous shape of the vertebrae with deep lateral fossae is diagnostic for the genus. No complete skull has been found, so the head shape is inferred from related titanosaurs and is thought to have been relatively small, narrow, and equipped with a beak‑like rostrum.  \n\nDiet: As a member of the Sauropoda, Argentinosaurus was a strict herbivore. Its peg‑shaped, leaf‑striping teeth were adapted for stripping vegetation rather than chewing, suggesting it swallowed large quantities of plant material whole. The long neck would have allowed it to browse at heights up to 15 metres (50 ft), accessing coniferous foliage, cycads, bennettitalean leaves, and early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to diversify in the Late Cretaceous. Gut fermentation would have broken down cellulose, with a slow metabolic rate suited to its massive size.  \n\nEnvironment: The Río Limay Formation records a semi‑arid to humid floodplain environment with seasonal rivers and expansive river‑levee systems. The climate was warm, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Vegetation was dominated by tall conifer forests, podocarp‑like trees, and abundant ferns, alongside low‑lying cycads and early angiosperms. Wide, open plains interspersed with dense patches of vegetation would have provided both feeding opportunities and space for these gigantic browsers. Seasonal flooding created rich alluvial soils, supporting the high primary productivity needed to sustain such enormous herbivores.  \n\nIn sum, Argentinosaurus represents the pinnacle of sauropod gigantism, thriving in a richly vegetated, flood‑dominated landscape of what is now north‑western Argentina during the middle Late Cretaceous. Its sheer size, inferred feeding strategy, and the fragmentary but impressive fossil record make it a cornerstone species for understanding the limits of terrestrial vertebrate growth.",

    "output": "Arrhinoceratops  \n\nSize  \n- Length: roughly 6 m (20 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: about 1.5 m (5 ft).  \n- Body mass: estimated 1.5–2 t, comparable to a modern bull.  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Late Cretaceous, Campanian stage, about 75 to 70 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens come from the Upper Cretaceous formations of southern Alberta, Canada, especially the Oldman and Dinosaur Park formations near the Milk River and Lethbridge area.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- A typical centrosaurine ceratopsian with a large, solid parietal frill edged by a series of low, flattened spikes.  \n- Unlike many relatives, the nasal horn is reduced to a small, low bump (hence the name “no‑nose‑horn”).  \n- Prominent brow horns project forward and slightly upward from the skull.  \n- The beaked mouth is a sharp, keratin‑covered rostral bone suited for cropping vegetation.  \n- The body is robust, with a deep torso, sturdy forelimbs ending in three‑toed hands, and strong hindlimbs ending in hoof‑like digits.  \n- The tail is relatively short and thick, balancing the heavy frill.  \n\nFossil records  \n- The holotype (specimen NMC 8546) consists of a partial skull, including the parietal frill, brow horns, and a fragmentary dorsal vertebrae series.  \n- Additional material (e.g., NMMNH P‑5226, ROM 1243) adds isolated teeth, limb bones, and vertebrae, confirming the overall anatomy and allowing estimates of size and posture.  \n- To date, fewer than a dozen specimens have been recovered, all from the same general region, suggesting a relatively limited geographic range or preservation bias.  \n\nDiet description  \n- Strictly herbivorous. The dental battery of dozens of tightly packed, leaf‑shaped teeth formed a grinding surface ideal for processing tough, fibrous plants.  \n- Likely fed on low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and conifer needles, supplemented by occasional shoots of flowering plants that had begun to diversify in the Campanian.  \n- The beak could shear foliage, while the cheek teeth pulverized it before swallowing.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \n- Lived in a coastal plain floodplain environment characterized by meandering river systems, seasonal streams, and periodic flood events that deposited the mudstones and sandstones of the Oldman/Dinosaur Park formations.  \n- Climate was warm temperate to subtropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons; precipitation supported lush riverbanks and a mosaic of open woodland and conifer‑dominated forests.  \n- The landscape featured a mix of low shrubs, ferns, and taller gymnosperm trees, providing both food sources and shelter.  \n- Large herbivores such as hadrosaurs and other ceratopsians shared the habitat, while predators like tyrannosaurids roamed the same ecosystems, creating a dynamic predator‑prey network.  \n\nOverall, Arrhinoceratops was a medium‑sized, heavily built ceratopsian adapted to browsing the diverse plant life of Late Cretaceous western North America, thriving in river‑influenced floodplain habitats that left a modest but informative fossil record.",

    "output": "Atlascopcosaurus – a small Australian ornithopod  \n\nSize  \n- Estimated total length: about 2.0–2.5 metres (6.5–8 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 0.9 metres (3 ft).  \n- Body mass: estimated 70–100 kg, comparable to a modern goat.  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Early Cretaceous, Aptian‑Albian stages.  \n- Radiometric dates from the surrounding strata place the animal at roughly 115 – 105 million years ago.  \n\nFossil location  \n- All known material comes from the “Atlas Copco” locality in western Queensland, Australia, about 100 km west of the town of Winton.  \n- The site is part of the lower Winton Formation, a fluvial‑deltaic sequence that records a flood‑plain environment.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Atlascopcosaurus was a bipedal, fast‑moving herbivore with a lightly built, slender skeleton.  \n- The skull was proportionally small; the preserved maxilla shows a beaked tip and a row of leaf‑shaped cheek teeth with fine ridges, suited for cropping vegetation.  \n- The fore‑limbs were relatively short but bore well‑developed hands with three functional digits, each ending in a small claw.  \n- The hind‑limbs were long and strong, with robust femora and elongated metatarsals, giving the animal good stride length.  \n- The tail was thickened toward the base, acting as a counter‑balance during rapid locomotion.  \n- Body covering is inferred to have been a mix of small, overlapping scales and simple filamentous feathers, as suggested for many basal iguanodontians.  \n\nFossil records  \n- Holotype: a partial right maxilla with several maxillary teeth (specimen QM F14501).  \n- Referred material: isolated dentary fragments, a few caudal vertebrae, portions of the left ilium, and several pedal phalanges, all catalogued in the Queensland Museum.  \n- To date, no complete skeleton has been recovered; the known elements represent less than 15 % of the total skeleton, so reconstructions rely on close relatives such as Anabisetia and Hypsilophodon.  \n\nDiet description  \n- Dental wear patterns and the shape of the teeth indicate a herbivorous diet focused on low‑lying plant material.  \n- Likely food sources included ferns, horsetails, seed ferns, low conifers, and the early flowering plants that began to diversify in the mid‑Cretaceous.  \n- The beaked snout would have been efficient at cropping foliage, while the cheek teeth processed plant matter before swallowing.  \n\nEnvironmental context  \n- The Atlas Copco locality preserves sediments of floodplain mudstones, channel sandstones and occasional paleosols, indicating a semi‑arid climate with seasonal rain.  \n- Rivers and meandering streams criss‑crossed the landscape, forming oxbow lakes and levees that supported lush riparian vegetation.  \n- Open woodlands of conifers and ginkgophytes dotted the floodplain, while more humid pockets along the watercourses hosted dense fern thickets and the first angiosperm shrubs.  \n- The ecosystem also hosted other dinosaurs (e.g., small theropods, early sauropods), crocodilian amphibians, turtles, and a diverse invertebrate fauna, creating a dynamic, mosaic habitat in which Atlascopcosaurus could forage and evade predators.  \n\nIn summary, Atlascopcosaurus was a modest‑sized, agile herbivore that inhabited the river‑dominated floodplains of Early Cretaceous Australia, grazing on a variety of low‑lying plants in a landscape shaped by seasonal wet‑dry cycles. Its fragmentary remains, though limited, provide valuable insight into the early diversification of ornithopod dinosaurs on the southern Gondwanan continents.",

    "output": "**Atrociraptor Overview**  \n\n**Size** – Atrociraptor was a modest‑sized dromaeosaurid, reaching about 1.5 m (5 ft) in total length from snout to tail tip and weighing roughly 12–18 kg (25–40 lb). Its body was lightweight and built for agility, with a long, stiff tail that acted as a counter‑balance during rapid turns.  \n\n**Geological Time Range** – The species lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically in the Campanian stage, approximately 76 to 75 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities** – All known Atrociraptor material comes from the Dinosaur Provincial Park region of southern Alberta, Canada, embedded in the upper part of the Dinosaur Park Formation. The type specimen (TMP 1992.83.1) and additional referred fragments have been recovered from the same stratigraphic layers that yield hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, and other theropods.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n\n- **Skull** – The skull was short and low‑ranged, about 15 cm in length, with a robust maxilla bearing a row of serrated teeth. The premaxilla carried a small, conical “banana‑shaped” tooth at the very front of the jaw.  \n- **Dentition** – Teeth were laterally compressed, recurved and possessed coarse denticulations, indicating a strong slicing ability. The dentary (lower jaw) shows a slight “U‑shaped” curvature typical of derived dromaeosaurids.  \n- **Limbs** – Forelimbs were relatively short but bore a well‑developed “sickle” claw on the second digit of each hand, reminiscent of Velociraptor. The hind limbs were elongated; the tibia exceeds the femur in length, a hallmark of fast runners.  \n- **Tail** – The caudal vertebrae are heavily ossified and feature elongated pre‑zygapophyseal processes, producing a stiff, rod‑like tail that helped maintain balance while chasing prey.  \n- ** integument** – Although no direct feather impressions have been found with Atrociraptor fossils, phylogenetic inference places it within the feathered dromaeosaurid clade, so it most likely sported a covering of simple filaments on its body and possibly more complex pennaceous feathers on the arms for display or limited gliding.  \n\n**Fossil Record** – The holotype consists of a partial skull (including maxilla, premaxilla, and braincase fragments), several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a partial pelvis, and left hind‑limb elements (femur, tibia, and foot). Additional specimens include isolated teeth, a few fore‑limb bones, and tail vertebrae that have been assigned to Atrociraptor on the basis of diagnostic features such as the shape of the maxillary antorbital fenestra and the morphology of the second pedal claw. All material is housed at the Royal Tyrrell Museum (TMP collection). The relatively scant but well‑preserved material provides a clear picture of a small, agile predator occupying the same ecosystems as larger theropods.  \n\n**Diet** – Atrociraptor was a carnivore and likely an opportunistic predator of small vertebrates. Its tooth morphology and strong jaw mechanics suggest it hunted juvenile dinosaurs (especially hatchling hadrosaurids and ceratopsians), small lizards, mammals, and possibly insects. The enlarged sickle claw on the second toe would have been used to deliver swift, fatal slashes to prey, while the grip of its fore‑limbs could have helped restrain struggling animals. Isotopic analysis of the tooth enamel (where available) points to a trophic level consistent with a high‑protein, meat‑based diet.  \n\n**Environment** – During the Campanian, the Dinosaur Park Formation represented a low‑lying, coastal plain traversed by meandering river systems and dotted with oxbow lakes, flood‑plains, and swamps. The climate was warm and humid, supporting a mosaic of conifer‑dominated forests, fern understories, and flowering plant (angiosperm) communities. Seasonal rains produced abundant vegetation, which in turn sustained large herbivore populations. Atrociraptor would have roamed among riparian woodlands and open flood‑plain scrub, using dense cover for ambush and the open ground for quick chases. The presence of numerous large herbivores, as well as a variety of smaller vertebrates, provided a steady supply of prey, while the dynamic riverine landscape offered both hunting grounds and nesting sites for the species.  \n\nIn summary, Atrociraptor was a small, feather‑covered dromaeosaurid predator of the Late Cretaceous coastal plains of what is now Alberta, Canada. Its agile build, sharp teeth, and lethal sickle claw made it an effective hunter of small vertebrates in a richly vegetated, river‑influenced environment.",

    "output": "Aucasaurus – overview  \n\nSize:  \nAucasaurus was a medium‑large theropod measuring about 6 to 7 metres (20–23 ft) in length and standing roughly 2 m (6.5 ft) tall at the hip. Its estimated body mass falls in the range of 600–900 kg (1,300–2,000 lb), comparable to a modern bull elk.  \n\nGeological period:  \nThe species lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically in the Campanian to early Maastrichtian stages, approximately 84–71 million years ago.  \n\nFossil location:  \nAll known Aucasaurus specimens come from the Argentine Patagonia, chiefly from the La Invernada and Bajo de la Carpa formations of the Neuquén Basin in north‑western Argentina. The type specimen (MACN‑P 545) was uncovered near the town of Auca Mahuida, which gives the genus its name.  \n\nPhysical description:  \n\n* Skull – A short, deep skull with a powerful bite; the jaws are lined with robust, serrated teeth that are slightly recurved. The skull lacks the large horns seen in some related abelisaurids, but it possesses a pair of low, bony ridges above the eyes.  \n\n* Arms – Very reduced forelimbs, about 30 cm (1 ft) long, ending in a single functional claw on each hand, similar to the condition seen in Carnotaurus.  \n\n* Post‑cranial skeleton – A compact, muscular torso supported by a robust pelvis and stout hind limbs. The femur is massive, indicating strong locomotor ability, though the animal was probably not built for sustained high‑speed running. The tail is thickened near the base, providing balance and a counter‑weight for the heavy front part of the body.  \n\n* Skin – Although no direct skin impressions are known, the close relative Abelisaurus shows evidence of small, non‑overlapping scales, so Aucasaurus likely possessed a similar scaley integument, possibly with low, bony armor plates (osteoderms) along the back and tail.  \n\nFossil record:  \n\nThe genus is known from a single, relatively complete skeleton (the holotype) discovered in 1984. This specimen includes most of the skull, vertebral column, pelvis, and both hind limbs, giving a comprehensive view of the animal’s anatomy. Additional fragmentary material – isolated teeth, a few vertebrae, and limb bone fragments – has been reported from the same formations, but none have been assigned to a distinct second species. The scarcity of material makes Aucasaurus one of the better‑known South American abelisaurids, yet still relatively rare compared to contemporaneous titanosaurs.  \n\nDiet:  \n\nAucasaurus was a carnivorous predator. Its powerful jaws, deep skull, and large, blade‑like teeth suggest a diet of medium to large herbivorous dinosaurs such as hadrosaurs, ceratopsian‑like ornithopods, and smaller titanosaurs. The reduced forelimbs indicate that the animal relied on its massive head and neck to seize and subdue prey, possibly delivering fatal bites to the neck or torso. Bite‑force estimates derived from skull morphology place its bite strength among the higher end for abelisaurids, sufficient to crush bone and tear flesh.  \n\nEnvironment:  \n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, the Neuquén Basin was a semi‑arid floodplain dotted with river channels, lakes, and occasional coastal incursions. The climate was warm and seasonal, with distinct wet and dry periods. Vegetation consisted of conifers, ginkgophytes, early flowering plants, and abundant ferns, creating a mosaic of open scrubland and riverine forests. This landscape supported diverse fauna: herbivorous titanosaurs, hadrosaurids, iguanodontians, and smaller ornithischians, as well as large crocodylomorphs and turtles. Aucasaurus would have occupied the top predator niche, stalking prey across the open plains and ambushing near water sources where herbivores gathered.  \n\nIn summary, Aucasaurus was a robust, mid‑sized abelisaurid theropod from Late Cretaceous Patagonia, characterized by a short, muscular skull, tiny forelimbs, and a body built for powerful, short‑range attacks on a variety of large herbivores within a warm, semi‑arid floodplain ecosystem.",

    "output": "Austrosaurus – General Overview  \n\nSize  \nAustrosaurus was a large, long‑necked sauropod. Based on the dimensions of the recovered vertebrae and comparative scaling with better‑known sauropods, it is estimated to have reached a total length of roughly 20–22 metres (65–72 ft) and a body mass in the neighbourhood of 25–30 tonnes. Its neck would have measured about 8 metres, the torso roughly 6 metres, and the tail another 6 metres.\n\nPeriod Range  \nThe fossils assigned to Austrosaurus come from rock layers dated to the Early Cretaceous, specifically the Aptian to Albian ages (approximately 125–100 million years ago). This places the animal in the middle part of the Cretaceous, when the Australian continent was still part of the southern super‑continent Gondwana.\n\nFossil Locality  \nAll known material was recovered from the eastern Australian state of Queensland. The type specimens were found near the town of Mackay, in the Mackay Basin, within the sedimentary sequence known as the Allaru (or Westbourne) Formation, which consists of fluvial sandstones and mudstones of Aptian‑Albian age. The discovery was made in the early 1930s and the material is now curated at the Queensland Museum, Brisbane.\n\nPhysical Description  \nAustrosaurus was a typical titanosauriform sauropod, possessing:  \n\n* A massive, columnar limb structure capable of supporting great weight. The fragmentary femur and tibia indicate a robust, straight‑shaped leg.  \n* A long, relatively low‑angled neck formed by at least 12 cervical vertebrae, each with elongated neural arches and deep pleurocoels (air‑filled cavities) that reduced skeletal weight.  \n* Dorsal vertebrae that are tall and barrel‑shaped, with well‑developed laminae and neural spines suggesting strong musculature along the back.  \n* A relatively short, thick tail composed of several caudal vertebrae that end in a blunt, possibly club‑like tip.  \n* Limited dermal armor; no osteoderms have been recovered, but related Australian sauropods sometimes carried scattered spinal plates, so Austrosaurus may have possessed a light covering of bony scutes.  \n\nBecause the material is fragmentary, many details (such as exact skull shape, fore‑limb proportions, and skin texture) remain speculative and are inferred from better‑known relatives like Opisthocoelicaudia and other Australian titanosaurs.\n\nFossil Record  \nThe holotype (QM A 10031) consists of:  \n\n* Several dorsal and caudal vertebrae with associated ribs.  \n* A partial left scapula fragment.  \n* A fragmentary femur piece and a tibial shaft fragment.  \n\nNo skull bones, complete limb girdles, or armor plates have been recovered. The scarcity of material has limited detailed phylogenetic analysis, but most recent studies place Austrosaurus within the broader clade Titanosauriformes, possibly close to the “Somphospondyli” of Gondwana. The genus is known only from this single locality; no additional specimens have yet been assigned to it.\n\nDiet Description  \nAs a sauropod, Austrosaurus was a strict herbivore. Its high browsing height would have allowed it to feed on foliage well above ground level, stripping leaves from conifers, cycads, bennettitaleans, and large ferns. By the Albian, early angiosperms (flowering plants) were beginning to spread in Gondwana, so it may also have taken advantage of young flowering shrubs. The presence of extensive gut flora and a massive digestive tract would have enabled it to process low‑nutrient plant material efficiently, extracting cellulose through bacterial fermentation.\n\nEnvironmental Setting  \nDuring the Aptian‑Albian, the region that is now eastern Queensland was a warm, humid, low‑latitude basin dominated by braided river systems, floodplains, and occasional coastal lagoons. The Allaru Formation records alternating sandstones (river channels) and mudstones (overbank deposits), indicating a dynamic landscape with seasonal flooding. Vegetation would have been dense, forming a mixed forest of tall conifers (e.g., Araucariaceae), tree ferns, and the aforementioned seed‑bearing plants. Open watery areas and forested margins provided a mosaic of habitats that could support large herbivores and the diverse fauna that co‑existed with Austrosaurus, including theropod dinosaurs, early crocodilians, turtles, and a variety of freshwater fish and insects. The climate was likely subtropical to tropical, with mean annual temperatures above 20 °C and abundant rainfall throughout the year.  \n\nIn summary, Austrosaurus represents one of the earliest large sauropods known from Australia. Though the fossil material is limited, the available bones give a clear picture of a massive, long‑necked herbivore living in lush, river‑dominated landscapes of Early Cretaceous Gondwana.",

    "output": "Avaceratops (meaning “bird‑like horned face”) is a small‑to‑medium sized ceratopsian that lived during the Late Cretaceous, roughly between 75 and 73 million years ago, at the very end of the Campanian stage.\n\nSize  \nAdult individuals are estimated to have reached about 4 to 5 metres (13–16 ft) in total length and stood approximately 1.8–2.0 metres (6 ft) tall at the hips. Body mass is thought to have been in the range of 800 kg to 1.2 tonnes.\n\nPeriod range  \nLate Campanian, Late Cretaceous (≈ 75–73 Ma).\n\nFossil location  \nAll known material comes from the Two Medicine Formation of north‑western Montana, United States. The type specimen (FMNH PR 1792) was recovered near the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, and additional skull fragments and post‑cranial bones have been collected from nearby localities within the same formation.\n\nPhysical description  \nAvaceratops possessed the classic ceratopsian body plan: a large, horny beak, a short, deep skull, and a modest frill edged with low, blunt epoccipitals. The frill is less elaborate than that of later ceratopsids such as Triceratops, but it bears a few small, spike‑like ornaments along its margin. The nasal and brow horns are reduced, appearing as low, rounded bumps rather than the long, sharp spikes seen in more derived forms. The neck was relatively robust, supporting a muscular body, while the fore‑limbs were short and stout, ending in three‑toe hands. The tail was long and stiffened with ossified tendons, likely used for balance.\n\nFossil records  \n- Holotype: FMNH PR 1792 – a partial skull roof with frill and portions of the nasal region.  \n- Additional specimens include several isolated cranial elements (frill plates, supraorbital bones) and fragmentary post‑cranial material (partial vertebrae, limb bones).  \n- To date, fewer than a dozen specimens have been assigned to Avaceratops, making it a relatively poorly known taxon, but the material is sufficient to confirm its placement among basal centrosaurine ceratopsians.\n\nDiet description  \nAvaceratops was a herbivore, feeding on the low‑lying vegetation available in its flood‑plain habitat. Its dental battery, composed of numerous tightly packed tooth rows, was well suited for cropping and grinding tough plant material. Likely food sources included ferns, horsetails, low‑lying conifers, and the leaves of cycad‑like seed plants. Seasonal variation may have forced it to supplement its diet with more fibrous, drought‑tolerant vegetation during the dry months.\n\nEnvironmental description  \nDuring the Late Campanian the Two Medicine Formation represented a semi‑arid, seasonally wet landscape dominated by broad, meandering river channels, oxbow lakes, and adjacent floodplains. The climate was warm with distinct wet and dry seasons. Vegetation was a mix of open coniferous woodlands, patches of deciduous angiosperms, and abundant fern and herbaceous understory. Periodic volcanic ash falls are recorded in the sedimentary layers, indicating occasional volcanic activity in the region. This mosaic of water sources, open spaces, and diverse plant life provided ample foraging opportunities for medium‑sized herbivores such as Avaceratops, while also supporting a community of predators (e.g., dromaeosaurids, early tyrannosaurids) and other herbivores (hadrosaurs, ankylosaurs).",

    "output": "Avimimus was a small, bird‑like theropod that lived in what is now eastern Mongolia during the Late Cretaceous.  \n\nSize – Adult individuals measured roughly 1.4 to 1.6 metres in total length, stood about 0.5 metre tall at the hips and weighed between 2 and 3 kilograms.  \n\nPeriod range – The species is known from the Campanian to the early Maastrichtian, a time span of roughly 84 to 70 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations – All confirmed specimens have been recovered from the Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert, particularly near the sites of Barun Goyot and the Flaming Cliffs. A few fragmentary remains attributed to Avimimus have also been reported from the nearby Djadochta Formation, but the Nemegt beds remain the principal source.  \n\nPhysical description – Avimimus possessed a lightweight, streamlined skeleton. The skull was short and low, ending in a small, tooth‑less beak that hints at a beaked, possibly keratin‑covered snout. The forelimbs were very short, each bearing a single functional digit that ended in a claw, while the hindlimbs were long and slender, built for fast, cursorial running. The pelvis and tail were reduced compared to more basal theropods, giving the animal a more compact silhouette. Impressions of filamentous feathers have been found on the forearms, thighs and tail, confirming that the animal was at least partially plumaged and likely able to use its feathers for display or balance rather than powered flight.  \n\nFossil record – The first fossils assigned to Avimimus were discovered in the early 1970s, but it was not formally described until 1996. Since then, more than a dozen reasonably complete skeletons have been collected, including several with well‑preserved feather traces. Some specimens retain portions of the gut contents, offering direct clues to diet, and one partial nest with eggs was found in close association, suggesting that the species nested in colonies similar to modern ground‑nesting birds.  \n\nDiet – The beak, lack of teeth, and the presence of gastroliths in the stomach region point to an omnivorous diet. Likely food items included insects, small vertebrates such as lizards or juvenile mammals, and a variety of plant material (seeds, fruits, and possibly soft leaves). The combination of a lightweight body and long legs would have allowed Avimimus to forage over large areas while the feathered forelimbs could have been used to capture small prey or manipulate food items.  \n\nEnvironment – In the Late Cretaceous the Nemegt Formation was a relatively humid, fluvial floodplain dotted with meandering river channels, oxbow lakes and occasional swampy basins. The climate was warm and seasonally wet, supporting a mix of conifer‑dominated woodlands, flowering plants, and open herbaceous patches along watercourses. This mosaic of habitats supplied ample insects, small vertebrates, and plant resources for a small, fast‑moving omnivore such as Avimimus. The presence of larger predators (e.g., Tarbosaurus) and abundant herbivorous dinosaurs (e.g., Saurolophus, Protoceratops) would have shaped its behavior, favoring swift running and possibly flocking as anti‑predator strategies.",

    "output": "**Bactrosaurus Overview**\n\n- **Size** – An adult Bactrosaurus measured about 7 to 9 metres (23–30 ft) in length and stood roughly 2 metres (6.5 ft) tall at the hip. Its body mass is estimated at 2–3 tonnes.\n\n- **Geological period** – Lived during the late Early Cretaceous to early Late Cretaceous, approximately 95–100 million years ago (Cenomanian–Turonian stages).\n\n- **Fossil locations** – All known specimens have been recovered from the Bayan Shireh and Nemegt formations of central and southern Mongolia, within the Gobi Desert region. The type specimen (IGM 100/10) was found near the Bayn Dzak locality.\n\n- **Physical description** –  \n  *Skull*: Relatively long and low, with a broad snout and a series of tightly packed, leaf‑shaped cheek teeth adapted for grinding plant material.  \n  *Dentition*: Possessed a dental battery of up to ten replacement teeth per position, indicating continuous tooth renewal.  \n  *Limbs*: Forelimbs were robust and longer than those of later hadrosaurids, ending in five‑fingered hands with powerful claws, suggesting they could grasp vegetation. Hind limbs were columnar, supporting a heavy body, and ended in three‑toed feet.  \n  *Tail*: Strong, muscular tail acted as a counter‑balance.  \n  *Skin*: No direct skin impressions are known, but based on close relatives it likely bore primitive scutes or low, scale‑like armor along the back and tail.\n\n- **Fossil record** – The genus is known from several partial skeletons, including near‑complete skulls, vertebral columns, limb bones and fragments of pelvic girdles. The most complete specimen (IGM 100/10) preserves an articulated skull with associated jaws, providing crucial information on its dentition and feeding mechanics. Additional isolated bones from the same formations confirm the presence of a modestly sized, basal hadrosaur in the Asian Cretaceous ecosystems.\n\n- **Diet** – Herbivorous. The broad, grinding cheek teeth and complex dental battery indicate a diet of low‑lying to mid‑height vegetation such as ferns, conifers, cycads and early flowering plants. The strong forelimbs could have been used to pull down branches or strip foliage, while the cheek‑pouch‑like cheeks (inferred from related hadrosaurs) allowed it to process large amounts of plant material before swallowing.\n\n- **Environmental setting** – Bactrosaurus inhabited a semi‑arid floodplain landscape dotted with river channels, lakes, and occasional forested patches. The Bayan Shireh region at that time experienced seasonal rainfall, supporting mixed vegetation of coniferous woodlands, ginkgoes, and abundant herbaceous plants. Periodic flooding created lush riparian zones that would have provided ample food resources, while open, drier areas offered space for herding and movement. The climate was warm with pronounced wet and dry seasons, a setting typical for many early hadrosaurid habitats in the Asian Cretaceous.",

    "output": "**Bagaceratops** – a small ceratopsian that lived in the Late Cretaceous of what is now Mongolia.\n\n**Size**  \nBagaceratops was a diminutive dinosaur, measuring roughly 1.2 to 1.5 metres (4–5 ft) in length from snout to tail and standing about 0.6 m (2 ft) tall at the hips. Its body mass is estimated at 15–20 kg, comparable to a medium‑sized dog.\n\n**Geological Period**  \nThe species is dated to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 83 to 72 million years ago. Some specimens may extend into the early Maastrichtian, but the bulk of the material clusters around 80 Ma.\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \nAll known Bagaceratops material comes from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, chiefly from the Bayan Shireh and Nemegt formations. Key sites include the Ukhaa Tolgod locality (Barun Goyot Formation) and the Tugrikin Shireh locality. The fossils are preserved in fluvial sandstones and mudstones that were once river‑plain deposits.\n\n**Physical Description**  \nBagaceratops possessed the classic ceratopsian body plan in miniature form. Its skull was about 20 cm long, bearing a short nasal horn, a modest brow ridge, and a small frill that lacked the large openings seen in later ceratopsids. The beak was sharply keratin‑capped, while the cheek teeth were leaf‑shaped and arranged in a dental battery suitable for grinding vegetation. The neck was relatively long, supporting a low, compact torso. Limbs were sturdy, with the forelimbs ending in five‑digit hands, the first digit being a reduced thumb spike. The hind limbs were longer than the forelimbs, giving the animal a slightly crouched gait. The tail was short and tapered, not used for balance as in larger ceratopsians.\n\n**Fossil Record**  \nBagaceratops is known from a relatively rich assemblage of specimens, including several nearly complete skulls, articulated partial skeletons, and isolated vertebrae, limb bones, and osteoderms. The first described material (Bagaceratops rozhdestvenskyi) was named in 1993 by Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska. Subsequent finds have refined its anatomy and confirmed that it represents a distinct, early member of Neoceratopsia, positioned phylogenetically just outside the more derived Protoceratopsidae.\n\n**Diet**  \nThe dentition and jaw mechanics indicate a herbivorous diet composed primarily of low‑lying plants. Bagaceratops likely fed on ferns, cycad leaves, and early angiosperm foliage, cropping vegetation with its beak and grinding it with its cheek teeth. Microwear studies on the teeth show a pattern of fine scratches consistent with browsing on soft, fibrous plant material rather than tough, gritty vegetation.\n\n**Environmental Context**  \nDuring the Campanian, the region that now forms the Gobi Desert was a semi‑arid floodplain dotted with river channels, lakes, and occasional sand dunes. The climate was seasonal, with warm, wet summers and cooler, drier winters. Vegetation would have consisted of open scrubland, river‑bank vegetation, and patches of conifer‑dominated woodlands. The ecosystem supported a diverse dinosaur fauna, including larger herbivores such as Protoceratops and the giant sauropod Opisthocoelicaudia, as well as carnivorous theropods like Velociraptor and the dromeosaurid Achillobator. Bagaceratops occupied the niche of a small, agile browser, likely using its speed and cryptic coloration to evade larger predators while foraging in the understory of this Late Cretaceous steppe‑lake landscape.",

    "output": "**Bambiraptor Description**\n\n**Size**  \nBambiraptor feinbergi was a relatively small dromaeosaurid, measuring about 1.2 to 1.4 meters (4–4.5 ft) in length from snout to tail tip. The body mass is estimated at roughly 5 kg (11 lb), comparable to a modern turkey.\n\n**Geologic Period**  \nThe species lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically in the Campanian stage, about 75 to 71 million years ago.\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \nAll known specimens of Bambiraptor have been recovered from the Kaiparowits Formation in southern Utah, United States, a part of the larger Grand Staircase‑Escalante region. The type specimen (UALVP 55700) was discovered near the town of Hanksville in 1993.\n\n**Physical Description**  \nBambiraptor possessed a slender, lightly built body with an elongated skull that featured a relatively large braincase, suggesting advanced sensory capabilities. The forelimbs were long and highly flexible, ending in hands with three functional digits, the second bearing an enlarged, sickle‑shaped claw characteristic of dromaeosaurids. Its hind limbs were proportionally long, indicating strong, agile locomotion. The tail was stiffened by elongated vertebral processes, providing balance during rapid turns. Feather impressions are not preserved, but phylogenetic inference places it among the feathered dromaeosaurids, likely bearing a covering of simple contour feathers and possibly more complex plumage along the arms and tail.\n\n**Fossil Record**  \nOnly a single, nearly complete but partially disarticulated skeleton is known, making Bambiraptor one of the best‑preserved but also most limited‑sampled small theropods from North America. The specimen includes a complete skull, vertebral column, pelvis, and most limb elements, allowing detailed anatomical study. No additional specimens have been reported, though isolated teeth and small theropod fragments from the same formation may belong to the same species.\n\n**Diet**  \nAs a small, fast predator, Bambiraptor is interpreted as an opportunistic carnivore. Its sharp, recurved teeth and powerful grasping claws suggest it hunted small vertebrates such as lizards, early mammals, and juvenile dinosaurs. It may also have scavenged carrion or taken insects and other invertebrates when larger prey were scarce.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Campanian, the Kaiparowits Formation represented a lush, subtropical floodplain within a coastal lowland ecosystem. The landscape included meandering rivers, swampy marshes, and conifer‑dominated forests interspersed with ferns and flowering plants. A diverse fauna shared this habitat: larger tyrannosaurids (e.g., Albertosaurus), hadrosaurid and ceratopsian herbivores, crocodilians, turtles, and abundant fish. The humid climate and abundant water sources would have supported a rich prey base for a small, agile predator like Bambiraptor, allowing it to exploit both terrestrial and near‑water hunting niches.",

    "output": "**Barapasaurus Description**\n\n**Size**  \nBarapasaurus was a medium‑large sauropod, reaching an estimated length of roughly 15–17 metres (50–55 ft) and a mass of about 12–15 tonnes. Its body was robust, with a long neck and tail, and columnar limbs supporting a heavy torso.\n\n**Geological Period**  \nThe species lived during the Early Jurassic, specifically in the Sinemurian to early Toarcian stages, about 190 to 182 million years ago.\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \nAll known Barapasaurus material comes from the Kota Formation of central India, chiefly from the Jabalpur region in the Pranhita‑Godavari Basin. The fossils were first collected in the late 1970s and formally described in 1981.\n\n**Physical Description**  \nBarapasaurus possessed the classic sauropod body plan: a relatively small skull with a short, deep snout, a long neck composed of moderately elongated cervical vertebrae, a massive barrel‑shaped torso, and a long, tapering tail. Its limbs were stout and column‑like, with thick femora and tibiae capable of bearing great weight. Compared with later sauropods, its neck was somewhat shorter and its vertebrae show more primitive, robust characteristics, such as well‑developed neural arches and pleurocoels (air-filled cavities). The dentition consisted of broad, leaf‑shaped teeth arranged in a relatively low‑crowned (brachydont) battery, suitable for cropping vegetation.\n\n**Fossil Record**  \nThe holotype (GSI 3) includes a partial skeleton: several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a sacrum, a few caudal vertebrae, the left scapula, portions of the pelvis, both humeri, radius and ulna, a femur, tibia, and several ribs. Additional referred material has yielded isolated teeth, vertebral fragments, and limb bone pieces, allowing paleontologists to reconstruct most of the post‑cranial anatomy. The preservation is fairly good, with many bones still in articulation, indicating rapid burial in river‑flood sediments.\n\n**Diet**  \nBarapasaurus was herbivorous. Its broad, low‑crowned teeth were adapted for shearing and stripping foliage rather than grinding. In the Early Jurassic ecosystems of India, it most likely fed on abundant gymnosperms such as conifers, as well as ferns, cycads, and primitive seed ferns that grew at low to mid‑level heights. The animal’s long neck would have permitted it to browse a relatively wide vertical range without moving its massive body.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Early Jurassic the Kota Formation represents a fluvial‑lacustrine landscape: meandering rivers, floodplains, and shallow lakes surrounded by vegetated banks. The climate was warm and seasonally wet, with a pronounced dry season. Vegetation was dominated by conifer‑like trees, horsetails, ferns, and other primitive seed plants. The region supported a diverse fauna including other early sauropods, temnospondyl amphibians, and various early theropods. Barapasaurus would have moved across the floodplain, feeding on the plentiful low‑lying vegetation while avoiding predators that prowled the river edges.",

    "output": "**Barosaurus – Overview**\n\n**Size**  \nBarosaurus was a very large sauropod, reaching lengths of approximately 24–27 meters (78–89 ft) from head to tail. Its body mass is estimated at 30–50 metric tons. The neck alone could be about 12–13 meters (40–43 ft) long, composed of at least 15 elongated cervical vertebrae, while the tail added another 6–7 meters. The animal stood on columnar legs that were roughly 2.5 m (8 ft) high at the hip.\n\n**Geological Period**  \nBarosaurus lived during the Late Jurassic, specifically in the Kimmeridgian to Tithonian ages, roughly 155 to 145 million years ago.\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \nThe most complete Barosaurus material comes from the Morrison Formation of the western United States. Key sites include:\n\n* Thomas Quarry (Colorado) – the type specimen (CM 11338) consisting of a partial skeleton with a well‑preserved neck.  \n* Quarry 13 at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (Colorado).  \n* Several isolated vertebrae and limb elements from Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico, all within the Morrison strata.\n\n**Physical Description**  \nBarosaurus was a classic long‑necked, quadrupedal herbivore. Its neck was proportionally longer than that of its better‑known relative Diplodocus, giving it a more “giraffe‑like” profile. The neck vertebrae are extremely elongated, with light‑weight pneumatic chambers that reduced weight while maintaining strength. The body was relatively slender for a sauropod, with a small, box‑shaped torso and a tapering tail that ended in a whip‑like tip. The skull, though rarely found, is thought to have been small, low, and equipped with a beak‑like mouth surrounded by peg‑shaped teeth suitable for stripping vegetation. The limbs were robust, with columnar fore‑ and hind‑limbs ending in broad, paddle‑shaped feet that bore five toes each on the fore‑limb and three on the hind‑limb. Skin impressions suggest a covering of small, polygonal scales rather than large scutes.\n\n**Fossil Record**  \nThe Barosaurus fossil record is relatively sparse compared to other Morrison sauropods, primarily because complete skeletons are rare. The holotype (CM 11338) includes a partial dorsal series, a series of cervical vertebrae, and parts of the pelvis and limbs. Additional material consists of isolated cervical and dorsal vertebrae, caudal vertebrae, and limb fragments that have been referred to Barosaurus on the basis of their distinctive proportions (e.g., extremely elongated neck vertebrae with low neural arches). Histological studies of the bone tissue indicate rapid growth rates typical of large sauropods. No definitive skull material has been securely assigned, though some fragmentary cranial pieces from the Morrison may belong to the genus.\n\n**Diet**  \nBarosaurus was a high‑browsing herbivore. Its long neck allowed it to reach vegetation up to 15 m (50 ft) above the ground, feeding on coniferous foliage, cycads, and possibly the upper fronds of bennettitalean plants. The peg‑shaped teeth, arranged in a simple row without complex grinding surfaces, indicate a primary function of stripping leaves rather than chewing. Food would have been swallowed whole and processed in a massive fermentation chamber within the gut, aided by a large, elongated intestine and a massive, multi‑chambered stomach typical of sauropods.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Late Jurassic, the Morrison Formation represented a semi‑arid to seasonally wet floodplain ecosystem, dotted with river channels, lakes, and low‑lying wetlands. The climate was warm with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Vegetation was dominated by conifer forests, towering araucarian and podocarp trees, low‑lying ferns, horsetails, and extensive stands of cycads and ginkgophytes. Open woodland and scrub areas provided a mosaic of food resources. Barosaurus shared its habitat with a diverse dinosaur fauna, including giant theropods such as Allosaurus, other sauropods like Diplodocus and Apatosaurus, ornithischians such as Camptosaurus and Stegosaurus, as well as numerous smaller reptiles, amphibians, and early mammals. The presence of large river systems would have contributed to the lush vegetation along their banks, offering ideal foraging grounds for the towering necked herbivore.",

Its most striking feature was a massive, curved claw on the first digit of each hand, measuring up to 31 cm (12 in) long. The jaws were elongated and lined with conical, unserrated teeth, many of which bore fine serrations near the tips. The lower jaw bore a distinctive, broad, spoon‑shaped tip that helped it grasp slippery prey. Its forelimbs were robust and relatively long, while its hind limbs were built for rapid, sustained running. The tail was stiffened by elongated chevrons, providing balance during fast locomotion. Skin impressions suggest a covering of small, non‑overlapping scales, with possible feathered proto‑feathers on the arms and tail, as inferred from related spinosaurids.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- The holotype (BMNH R4997) consists of a partial skeleton with a nearly complete skull, several vertebrae, ribs, a left fore‑arm, and the characteristic thumb claw.  \n- Additional specimens include isolated teeth, vertebrae, and partial forelimbs from the Isle of Wight, Spain (Barrosa Formation) and France (Bresse).  \n- The combined material provides a fairly complete picture of the skull and post‑cranial anatomy, making Baryonyx one of the best‑known spinosaurids.  \n\n**Diet**  \nBaryonyx is interpreted as a semi‑aquatic predator that primarily fed on fish, much like modern gharials. Evidence supporting this includes:  \n- Conical, unserrated teeth ideal for grasping slippery prey.  \n- The large, curved manual claw likely used to hook or slash at fish or other small vertebrates.  \n- Fossilized fish scales and vertebrae found in the stomach region of the holotype specimen.  \n- Isotopic analyses of bone collagen indicate a diet rich in aquatic organisms, though occasional consumption of small dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and carrion cannot be ruled out.  \n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Barremian, the regions that now constitute southern England and northern Spain were part of a warm, semi‑humid coastal plain bordering extensive river systems, floodplains, and shallow lagoons. The climate was temperate to subtropical, with seasonal rainfall supporting lush vegetation of ferns, conifers, and early flowering plants. Rivers and deltas created abundant fish populations, providing a reliable food source for Baryonyx. The surrounding landscape also hosted a diverse dinosaur fauna, including iguanodontians, small ornithopods, and other theropods, offering opportunistic feeding opportunities when fish were scarce. The combination of water‑rich habitats and abundant prey made the early Cretaceous floodplain an ideal setting for this fishing-adapted predator.",

    "output": "Becklespinax (meaning “Beckles’ spine”) is a little‑known ornithischian dinosaur that was named in 1923 by Franz Nopcsa on the basis of a single, unusually tall neural arch recovered from the Purbeck Limestone of southern England. Because the material is very fragmentary, the genus is regarded as a nomen dubium, but it is generally interpreted as an early ankylosaur‑ or stegosaur‑type armored dinosaur.  \n\n**Size** – The preserved neural spine suggests a relatively low‑slung animal. If it belonged to a small ankylosaur, estimates place the total length at roughly 2 to 3 metres (6.5–10 ft) and a height of about 1 metre at the shoulder. Mass would have been in the range of 200–400 kg.  \n\n**Geological period** – The fossil comes from the Purbeck Group, which spans the latest Jurassic (Tithonian) into the earliest Cretaceous (Berriasian), roughly 146 to 140 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil locality** – The only confirmed specimen (NHMUK R 12345, a dorsal neural arch with a tall, laterally compressed spine) was collected near the village of Langton Quarry on the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, United Kingdom. A few isolated dermal plates from the same strata have been tentatively associated with the taxon, but they lack diagnostic features.  \n\n**Physical description** – The neural arch is tall, slender and bears a series of longitudinal ridges, indicating a pronounced dorsal “sail” or ridge formed by elongated spines. The bone surface shows rugose ornamentation typical of osteoderm‑bearing dinosaurs. The overall body plan would have been quadrupedal, with a broad, heavily armored torso, a low head equipped with a small beak, and possibly a row of small conical spikes running down the back. The limbs were stout, suited for supporting a heavy, armored body.  \n\n**Fossil record** – Apart from the type neural arch, the record for Becklespinax consists of a handful of isolated armor plates and a few indeterminate vertebral fragments from the same Purbeck beds. No cranial material or complete skeleton has ever been recovered, which explains why the genus remains poorly understood and is often regarded as a dubious taxon.  \n\n**Diet** – As an herbivore, Becklespinax would have fed on the low‑lying vegetation that dominated the Purbeck floodplain: ferns, horsetails, seed ferns, small cycads and the tender shoots of early conifers. The beak and leaf‑shaped cheek teeth (inferred from related ankylosaurs) would have been effective for cropping and grinding tough, fibrous plants.  \n\n**Environment** – The Purbeck Limestone represents a coastal lagoonal system that fluctuated between freshwater marshes, tidal flats and semi‑arid scrubland. Seasonal wet and dry periods created a mosaic of habitats: swampy margins rich in aquatic plants, sandy dunes, and open low‑lying woodlands. Climate was warm temperate, with relatively high humidity during the wet season and drier conditions in summer. This varied landscape supported a diverse fauna including early crocodylomorphs, turtles, pterosaurs, and small theropods, with Becklespinax occupying the niche of a low‑grazing, heavily armored herbivore.  \n\nIn summary, Becklespinax is a fragmentary but intriguing example of early armored dinosaurs living on the edge of the Jurassic–Cretaceous transition in what is now southern England. Its size, anatomy and lifestyle are inferred from a single dorsal spine and comparisons with better‑known ankylosaur and stegosaur relatives, painting a picture of a modestly sized, spiny herbivore roaming lagoon‑border habitats over 140 million years ago.",

    "output": "Beipiaosaurus is a small, feather‑covered therizinosaurian dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous.  \n\nSize  \nThe animal measured roughly 2 to 2.5 metres in total length and stood about 70 cm tall at the hip. Its body mass is estimated at 40–50 kg, making it one of the smaller members of the Therizinosauria.\n\nPeriod range  \nBeipiaosaurus lived about 125 to 122 million years ago, during the Barremian–Early Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous.\n\nFossil location  \nAll known specimens come from the Yixian Formation of western Liaoning Province, China, near the town of Beipiao (hence the name). The strata are part of the Jehol Biota, a volcanically active lake‑deposit environment.\n\nPhysical description  \n- Skeleton: a lightly built, bipedal build with a long neck and relatively short tail. The forelimbs are robust and end in large, recurved claws about 10 cm long.  \n- Skull: a low, elongated skull with a small beak and a few tiny, leaf‑shaped teeth confined to the front of the jaws.  \n- Integument: impressions show a covering of simple, down‑like feathers over the torso, neck and tail, and longer, filamentous “proto‑feathers” on the arms and hind limbs.  \n- Skin: no scales are preserved, but the feather impressions suggest a plumose integument rather than reptilian scutes.  \n\nFossil records  \nThe holotype (IVPP V11576) consists of a nearly complete skeleton with articulated vertebrae, limbs and a partial skull, plus an associated slab preserving feather traces. Additional referred material includes isolated limb bones, vertebrae and more feathered skin impressions recovered from the same horizon. These specimens represent some of the best‑preserved non‑avian dinosaurs from the Jehol deposits and provide the first clear evidence of feathers in a non‑maniraptoran theropod.\n\nDiet description  \nBeipiaosaurus is interpreted as primarily herbivorous. The beak and reduced teeth would have been suitable for cropping low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads and conifer needles. The large manual claws could have been used to pull branches within reach or to dig for roots and tubers. Some researchers suggest a limited omnivorous component, based on the presence of small, serrated teeth, but the overall anatomy points toward a plant‑based diet.\n\nEnvironmental description  \nThe Yixian Formation records a cool, temperate climate punctuated by frequent volcanic eruptions. The landscape comprised a mosaic of volcanic ash‑covered floodplains, shallow lakes and wet forested areas. Vegetation included coniferous trees, ginkgos, bennettitales, ferns and early angiosperms. Seasonal rains created abundant wetlands, while periodic ash falls rapidly buried organisms, leading to the exceptional preservation seen in the Jehol Biota. Beipiaosaurus would have inhabited the understory of these forests, foraging among ferns and low branches and possibly seeking refuge in the dense vegetation when volcanic activity erupted nearby.",

    "output": "**Bellusaurus (Bellusaurus sui)**  \n\n**Size**  \nBellusaurus was a relatively small sauropod. Adult individuals are estimated to have reached lengths of about 3.5‑4.0 metres (11‑13 ft) and a mass of roughly 400‑600 kg (≈ 900‑1 300 lb). Its neck was proportionally long, comprising twelve to fourteen cervical vertebrae, while the body and tail were compact compared with later giant sauropods.  \n\n**Geological Age (Period Range)**  \nThe genus lived during the Late Jurassic, specifically in the Oxfordian‑Tithonian interval, approximately 155 to 150 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \nAll known Bellusaurus material comes from the Upper Shaximiao Formation of the Sichuan Basin in southwestern China, near the town of Zigong. The formation is a well‑known Jurassic deposit that has yielded numerous sauropod remains.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \nBellusaurus is classified as a basal macronarian sauropod. Its anatomy displays a blend of primitive and more derived traits:  \n\n* **Neck:** Long and slender, with elongated cervical vertebrae bearing low, weakly developed neural spines, suggesting a relatively flexible neck for browsing at various heights.  \n* **Skull:** Fragmentary, but the preserved teeth are pencil‑shaped, slightly leaf‑like, and spaced relatively far apart, indicating a non‑selective herbivorous diet.  \n* **Limbs:** Forelimbs are shorter than the hindlimbs, a condition typical of early sauropods. The limb bones are robust yet not massively pneumatic, reflecting its modest size.  \n* **Tail:** Shorter and sturdier than in later sauropods, ending in a modestly tapering series of vertebrae.  \n* **Dermal Armor:** Some isolated ossicles have been tentatively referred to Bellusaurus, hinting at a light covering of small bony plates along the neck and back, though this remains controversial.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \nThe holotype (specimen IVPP V.10871) consists of a partial skeleton recovered in 1976, including a series of cervical vertebrae, portions of the dorsal vertebrae, sacrum, scapulae, partial fore‑ and hind‑limb elements, and assorted ribs. Additional referred material comprises isolated teeth, vertebrae, and limb fragments from the same formation, representing at least three individuals of varying ages, which together provide a fairly complete picture of the skeleton despite the lack of a complete skull. All specimens are housed at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing.  \n\n**Diet**  \nBellusaurus was a herbivore. Its spatulate, moderately leaf‑shaped teeth are suited for cropping and occasional chewing of soft vegetation. In the lush Jurassic floodplains of the Shaximiao Formation, it would have fed on low‑lying ferns, cycads, and the foliage of coniferous trees such as *Cunninghamia*‑type members, as well as herbaceous horsetails. The modest size and flexible neck would have allowed it to browse both at ground level and several meters up into the mid‑canopy.  \n\n**Paleoenvironment**  \nDuring the Late Jurassic, the Upper Shaximiao Formation represented a warm, humid floodplain crossed by meandering rivers and dotted with seasonal lakes. The climate was subtropical, with abundant precipitation supporting dense forests of conifers, ginkgoes, cycads, and ferns. Periodic volcanic ash falls are recorded in the sedimentary layers, indicating nearby volcanic activity that contributed to rapid burial of carcasses—a factor that helped preserve the Bellusaurus skeletons. The ecosystem hosted a diverse fauna, including other sauropods (e.g., *Mamenchisaurus*), theropods (e.g., *Szechuanosaurus*), ornithischians, early mammals, and abundant crocodilians, creating a dynamic community in which Bellusaurus likely occupied the niche of a smaller, more agile browser.  \n\nIn summary, Bellusaurus was a modest‑sized, early macronarian sauropod from the Late Jurassic of Sichuan, China. Its fossils provide valuable insight into the early diversification of long‑necked sauropods and the rich, river‑dominated habitats they inhabited.",

    "output": "Borogovia – a small, bird‑like theropod of the Late Cretaceous  \n\nSize  \nBorogovia was a modest‑sized dinosaur, reaching roughly 1.5 to 2.0 metres (5–6.5 ft) in total length. Its body mass is estimated at about 15–25 kilograms (33–55 lb), comparable to a large turkey or a small dog.  \n\nPeriod range  \nThe only known specimens come from the Barun Goyot Formation of Mongolia, which dates to the late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, about 72 to 69 million years ago.  \n\nFossil location and records  \nAll material attributed to Borogovia has been recovered from the Gobi Desert, specifically from the Upper Barun Goyot beds near the Khulsan locality. The holotype (MFG 1/54) consists of a partial right foot, including the metatarsals and several phalanges. Additional referred elements are fragmentary toe bones and a few isolated ankle fragments. Because the remains are limited to the distal hind‑limb, the genus is known chiefly from its unique foot morphology, which helped distinguish it from other Mongolian troodontids such as Saurornithoides and Troodon.  \n\nPhysical description  \nBased on the foot anatomy and comparison with better‑known troodontids, Borogovia is inferred to have been a lightly built, bipedal predator with a long, gracile tail for balance. Its hind‑limb was relatively elongated, ending in a three‑toed foot with a pronounced, sickle‑shaped second toe claw. The metatarsals were slender, indicating swift, agile movement. The skull, though not preserved, would likely have been small with a proportionally large braincase, large eyes, and a beak‑like snout, typical of troodontids. The forelimbs were probably long with a semi‑flexible wrist and clawed hands, useful for grasping prey.  \n\nDiet  \nTroodontids are generally considered omnivorous‑carnivorous, and Borogovia would have fit this pattern. Its sharp, recurved second toe claw and agile foot suggest a diet of small vertebrates—lizards, mammals, and juvenile dinosaurs—augmented by insects, carrion, and possibly plant material such as seeds or fruits. The enlarged optic lobes inferred from troodontid skulls point to keen vision for hunting in low‑light conditions.  \n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the late Campanian the Barun Goyot region was a semi‑arid steppe with occasional sand dunes, interdune oases, and flood‑plain lakes. Vegetation consisted of xerophytic plants: low shrubs, hardy conifers, and early flowering plants adapted to dry conditions. The climate was seasonal, with warm, dry summers and cooler, slightly wetter winters. This mosaic of open ground and sparse vegetation would have supported a diverse assemblage of small vertebrates, insects, and opportunistic scavengers, providing ample food sources for a swift, opportunistic predator like Borogovia.  \n\nIn summary, Borogovia was a small, agile troodontid that lived about 70 million years ago in the dry steppelands of what is now Mongolia, surviving on a varied diet of small animals and insects, and is known chiefly from a distinctive partial foot discovered in the Barun Goyot Formation.",

    "output": "Brachiosaurus  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 22–26 meters (72–85 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the shoulder: roughly 9–10 meters (30–33 ft); the elevated neck allowed a head height of up to 12–13 meters (40 ft).  \n- Mass: estimated 35–55 metric tonnes.  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic, approximately 154 to 153 million years ago, in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation and contemporaneous African deposits.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- North America: primarily the Morrison Formation of the western United States (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico). The most complete specimen, “Brachiosaurus altithorax” (CM 3018), was found near Grand River, Colorado.  \n- Africa: the Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania yielded a giant sauropod originally called Brachiosaurus brancai, now usually assigned to the separate genus Giraffatitan, but still illustrative of the African brachiosaurine record.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- A classic “giraffe‑sauropod” shape with a long, giraffe‑like neck that rose steeply upward; the fore‑limbs were markedly longer than the hind‑limbs, giving a sloping back.  \n- Massive, columnar limbs with robust, barrel‑shaped humeri; weight‑bearing feet bore broad, rounded toe pads.  \n- Skull relatively small compared with body size, with nostrils positioned high on the snout, possibly near the top of the head.  \n- Teeth were peg‑shaped, spoon‑like leaf‑eaters, set in a wide mouth that could sweep large amounts of vegetation.  \n- Tail was relatively short and thick, ending in a broad, muscular “club” of vertebrae.  \n\nFossil records  \n- The first Brachiosaurus material was discovered in 1900 by Elmer Riggs; the type species B. altithorax was named in 1903. The holotype includes a partial vertebral column, several dorsal ribs, scapulae, and a fragmentary fore‑limb.  \n- Subsequent finds have added neck vertebrae, pelvic elements, and additional limb bones, allowing reconstruction of the full skeletal shape.  \n- In Tanzania, the Tendaguru expeditions (1909–1913) uncovered dozens of skeleton parts, the most complete of which became the basis for Giraffatitan brancai; these fossils preserve a nearly complete cervical series, dorsal vertebrae, and a full fore‑limb, providing the best insight into brachiosaurine anatomy.  \n- Geological dating of the surrounding matrix and associated index fossils (e.g., Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus) firmly place these specimens in the Late Jurassic.  \n\nDiet description  \n- Strict herbivore, feeding high in the forest canopy and on low‑lying vegetation when necessary.  \n- Dental wear patterns indicate a diet of soft conifer needles, cycads, ginkgophytes, and possibly fern fronds. The high browsing habit allowed exploitation of foliage beyond the reach of most other sauropods, reducing competition.  \n- Likely required several thousand kilograms of plant material each day to sustain its massive body, using a slow, continuous feeding strategy.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \n- Inhabited warm, semi‑arid floodplains and river‑valley ecosystems that dotted the interior of the Jurassic supercontinent.  \n- The Morrison Formation landscape featured seasonal rivers, lakes, and abundant vegetation, including towering conifer forests, cycads, and horsetail stands, providing both food and water sources.  \n- The climate was seasonal, with wet summers and drier winters, supporting a diverse dinosaur fauna (theropods, other sauropods, ornithischians) and large herbivore herds.  \n- African Tendaguru habitats were similar, with lush, tropical‑like vegetation along coastal lagoons and deltas, allowing brachiosaurines to thrive in a rich, mixed‑forest environment.  \n\nOverall, Brachiosaurus was a towering, long‑necked sauropod uniquely adapted for high browsing in the verdant floodplain and forested landscapes of the Late Jurassic, leaving a fossil record that has helped paleontologists reconstruct the appearance, biology, and world of these iconic giants.",

    "output": "Brachylophosaurus – Overview  \n\nSize  \nBrachylophosaurus was a medium‑large hadrosaurid, reaching lengths of about 9 to 10 meters (30–33 ft) and a hip‑height of roughly 2.5 m (8 ft). Adult individuals weighed an estimated 3 to 4 tonnes.\n\nGeological time range  \nThe species lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically in the Campanian stage, about 81 to 75 million years ago.\n\nFossil localities  \nMost specimens have been recovered from the Upper Cretaceous Judith River and Two Medicine formations of north‑western Montana, USA. Additional fragmentary material has been found in the Wahweap Formation of southern Utah and in the Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah, extending the known geographic range slightly to the south‑west.\n\nPhysical description  \nBrachylophosaurus possessed the typical duck‑bill skull of hadrosaurids, with a flat, broad snout and a modestly developed nasal crest that ran horizontally across the top of the skull, giving the animal its name (“short crest lizard”). The crest was formed of solid bone rather than a soft tissue display structure. The skull measured about 1 m (3 ft) in length. Its body was built for efficient quadrupedal locomotion, with strong forelimbs and robust hind limbs; the tail was long and muscular, likely used for balance. The dentition consisted of a battery of tightly packed grinding teeth (up to 60 teeth per side) positioned behind a beak, ideal for processing plant material. Skin impressions from the “MOR 2599” specimen suggest a coat of small, polygonal scales, with larger scutes along the dorsal midline.\n\nFossil record highlights  \n- The “MOR 259” specimen, a near‑complete skeleton discovered near Glendive, Montana, provided the first detailed skull and post‑cranial anatomy.  \n- The “Brachylophosaurus canadensis” “MOR 2599” (the “Brachylophosaurus mummy”) recovered in 1994 preserved skin impressions, a rare soft‑tissue fossil.  \n- The “Willo” (MOR 1157) specimen, a juvenile, has contributed to understanding growth patterns and ontogeny.  \n- Multiple bonebeds in the Two Medicine Formation contain dozens of individuals, indicating possible herd behavior and seasonal migrations.  \n\nDiet  \nAs a member of the hadrosaurid clade, Brachylophosaurus was an herbivore. Its dental battery allowed it to grind tough vegetation, including coniferous needles, cycads, ferns, and the leaves of early flowering plants (angiosperms) that proliferated in the Late Cretaceous. Wear patterns on the teeth suggest a combination of browsing (higher foliage) and grazing (low‑lying plants). The beak could crop vegetation, while the cheek‑pouch‑like oral cavity retained food for extended chewing, much like modern herbivorous mammals.\n\nEnvironmental setting  \nBrachylophosaurus inhabited a semi‑arid to subtropical floodplain ecosystem that experienced seasonal precipitation. The Judith River and Two Medicine formations represent a mosaic of river channels, oxbow lakes, and expansive floodplains fringed by conifer‑dominated forests and open fern‑and‑cycad meadows. Volcanic ash layers indicate occasional volcanic activity in the region. The climate was warm, with relatively high humidity during the growing season, supporting a rich understory of plants that could sustain large herbivore populations. Predators such as tyrannosaurids (e.g., Daspletosaurus) and dromaeosaurids would have been present, influencing herd behavior and migration patterns. Water sources were abundant in the riverine corridors, providing drinking water and a venue for the seasonal congregation of herds.",

    "output": "Brachytrachelopan (meaning “short‑necked pan”) is a dicraeosaurid sauropod that lived in what is now western Argentina during the Late Jurassic.  \n\nSize  \nBrachytrachelopan was a relatively small sauropod. The most reliable estimates place the animal at roughly 8–10 metres in total length and a mass of about 4–6 tonnes. Its most striking feature is an unusually short neck – the cervical series is reduced to about 12 short vertebrae, giving the head a low, almost ground‑level position.\n\nPeriod range  \nFossils are dated to the latest Jurassic, specifically the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian interval, approximately 155 to 150 million years ago.\n\nFossil locations  \nAll known material comes from the Upper Jurassic deposits of the Neuquén Basin in Patagonia, Argentina. The holotype was collected from the Cerro Bayo Formation (sometimes referred to as the Cañadón Asfalto or La Matilde beds, depending on the stratigraphic interpretation) near the town of Pueblo Liebig in Mendoza Province. The site is a fluvial‑lacustrine succession that has also yielded remains of other dinosaurs, fishes and plant fossils.\n\nPhysical description  \nThe skeleton is only partially known, but several diagnostic elements are preserved: a series of cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a sacrum, portions of the pelvis, and parts of the fore‑ and hind‑limbs. The vertebrae are low‑spined and robust, with tall neural spines that are typical of dicraeosaurids. The neck is markedly shortened compared to other sauropods, and the skull (still unknown in life) is inferred to have been small and low‑set. The limbs are columnar but relatively stout, supporting a body that was more compact than that of the giant long‑necked sauropods. The tail is long and likely flexible, ending in a small club‑like tip seen in related taxa.\n\nFossil record  \nOnly a single, relatively complete specimen (designated MPCA 108) has been described, representing the type species Brachytrachelopan mesai. The material consists of 12 cervicals, 9 dorsals, the sacrum, isolated ribs, and fragmentary limb bones. No cranial material has been recovered. The specimen is housed at the Museo Paleontológico de la Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. No additional specimens have been reported, making Brachytrachelopan one of the best‑known but still poorly sampled dicraeosaurids.\n\nDiet description  \nLike all sauropods, Brachytrachelopan was herbivorous, but its short neck implies a feeding strategy focused on low vegetation. It would have browsed on ferns, horsetails, low‑lying cycads and possibly the foliage of small conifers growing close to the ground. The dentition, inferred from related dicraeosaurids, would have been leaf‑shaped with coarse serrations, suitable for cropping tough, fibrous plants.\n\nEnvironmental description  \nDuring the Late Jurassic the Neuquén Basin was a mosaic of floodplains, river channels, lakes and volcanic ash fields. The climate was generally warm and seasonally dry, with a pronounced wet season that supported lush riparian vegetation. Plant assemblages included extensive fern thickets, horsetail stands, low‑lying cycads and scattered coniferous trees such as podocarps. Open woodland and swampy lowlands would have provided a diversity of food sources for herbivores. Periodic volcanic activity deposited layers of tephra that helped preserve the sedimentary sequence in which Brachytrachelopan fossils are found. The environment would have been shared with other herbivorous dinosaurs (such as basal sauropodomorphs and early titanosaurs), small ornithischians, as well as theropod predators that likely hunted in the same floodplain ecosystem.",

    "output": "**Buitreraptor**  \n\nSize  \n- Estimated length: about 1.5 – 2 meters (5 – 6.5 ft).  \n- Height at the hip: roughly 0.6 meters (2 ft).  \n- Weight: around 10–20 kilograms (22–44 lb), similar to a modern medium‑sized raptor.  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Early Cretaceous, specifically the Aptian–Albian stages, roughly 120–110 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the “Candeleros Formation” (also called the “Buitrera Formation”) in the Patagonia region of north‑western Argentina, near the town of Chubut. The type locality is the “La Buitrera” fossil site, which gives the genus its name.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Buitreraptor was a small, lightly built theropod belonging to the Dromaeosauridae, close to the South‑American subfamily Unenlagiinae.  \n- It possessed a long, slender snout with numerous small, tightly spaced teeth that were laterally compressed, indicating a grasping rather than crushing function.  \n- The forelimbs were proportionally long (about 60 % of total body length) and ended in a hand with three functional digits; the second digit bore the characteristic sickle‑shaped claw (the “killing claw”) typical of dromaeosaurs.  \n- The hind limbs were cursorial, with elongated tibiae and metatarsals, suggesting strong running ability.  \n- The tail was stiffened by elongated chevron bones and ossified tendons, providing balance during rapid maneuvers.  \n- Feather impressions are not preserved, but based on close relatives it is inferred that Buitreraptor bore a covering of contour feathers, possibly with pennaceous flight‑type feathers on the arms and tail.  \n\nFossil records  \n- The holotype (MPCN-PV 177) consists of a partial skeleton: a nearly complete skull, lower jaws, several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, scapulocoracoid, partial fore‑ and hind‑limb elements, and a partial tail.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated teeth, limb fragments, and vertebrae from the same formation, expanding knowledge of variation within the species.  \n- The preservation is relatively good, with some bones still articulated, allowing detailed study of the skull and forelimb morphology.  \n\nDiet description  \n- The dental morphology (small, recurved, blade‑like teeth) and the presence of a large sickle claw suggest a predatory lifestyle focused on small vertebrates.  \n- Likely prey included early mammals, lizards, amphibians, and possibly juvenile dinosaurs.  \n- The relatively weak bite force inferred from the slender jaws indicates Buitreraptor relied more on swift strikes, grasping, and slashing with the enlarged second toe claw rather than crushing large prey.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \n- During the Early Cretaceous, the Patagonia region where Buitreraptor lived was a semi‑arid to open‑forest landscape, featuring river channels, floodplains, and scattered conifer‑type vegetation.  \n- The Candeleros Formation records a mix of fluvial sandstones and mudstones, indicating a setting of meandering rivers and occasional lake basins.  \n- Climate was warm temperate, with seasonal rainfall that supported a diverse fauna: sauropod and titanosaurian herbivores, early carcharodontosaurid theropods, small ornithischians, and a rich assemblage of crocodilians, turtles, and fish.  \n- Such an ecosystem would have provided ample opportunities for a small, agile predator like Buitreraptor to hunt in the understory and along riverbanks, using its speed and agility to catch quick prey while avoiding larger carnivores.

    "output": "Camarasaurus  \n\nSize  \n- Length: 15–18 metres (49–59 ft) from head to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: about 4 metres (13 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 18–23 tonnes.  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic, approximately 155 to 145 million years ago, spanning the Kimmeridgian to the early Tithonian stages.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- The most abundant material comes from the Morrison Formation of the western United States (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma).  \n- Additional specimens have been found in the Sundance Formation of Idaho and the Lourinhã Formation of Portugal, indicating a broader Laurasian distribution.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Camarasaurus was a classic sauropod with a massive, barrel‑shaped torso supported by a columnar neck of 12–13 vertebrae.  \n- Its neck was relatively short and robust compared to the ultra‑long necks of diplodocids, giving the animal a powerful bite.  \n- The skull was large, square‑shaped, and featured large, spoon‑shaped teeth that projected forward, suited for stripping vegetation.  \n- The tail was thick and tapering, ending in a small, bony club‑like tip in some species.  \n- Limb bones were thick and columnar, with a pronounced “U‑shaped” femur and stout humerus, supporting its great weight.  \n\nFossil records  \n- More than 30 partial skeletons and several nearly complete individuals have been recovered, making Camarosaurus one of the best‑known Morrison sauropods.  \n- The holotype, CM 113, a nearly complete skeleton from Como Bluff, Wyoming, was described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877.  \n- Recent finds include a remarkably complete juvenile (MOR 480) that has clarified growth patterns, and a series of trackways attributed to Camarasaurus that show a gait with a relatively narrow stance compared with other sauropods.  \n\nDiet description  \n- Camarasaurus was an obligate herbivore. Its large, spatulate teeth were capable of cropping tough, fibrous plants.  \n- Wear patterns suggest it fed on high‑browse vegetation such as conifers, cycads, and possibly ginkgophytes, stripping foliage rather than grinding it.  \n- The animal likely swallowed large amounts of plant material, relying on a massive gut and microbial fermentation to break down cellulose.  \n\nEnvironment  \n- The Morrison ecosystem was a semi‑arid floodplain dotted with river channels, lakes, and seasonal wetlands.  \n- Vegetation was dominated by conifer forests, horsetails, ferns, and low‑lying cycad‑like plants, providing abundant browse for large herbivores.  \n- Climate was warm with seasonal rainfall, creating a mosaic of open woodlands and wetter low‑lying areas.  \n- Camarasaurus shared its world with other sauropods (Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus), large theropods (Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus), and a diverse assemblage of ornithischians, crocodilians, and early mammals, forming a complex food web in the Late Jurassic.",

    "output": "**Camptosaurus – Overview**  \n\n**Size**  \n- Length: roughly 16–18 metres (52–60 ft) from tip of snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hip: about 2.5–3 metres (8–10 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 2–5 tonnes (4,400–11,000 lb), depending on the specimen and the species.\n\n**Geologic Time Range**  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic to early Late Cretaceous, approximately 157 to 100 million years ago.  \n- The bulk of known material comes from the Oxfordian–Kimmeridgian stages of the Late Jurassic (≈ 163–152 Ma), with some later finds tentatively placed in the Barremian (≈ 129–125 Ma).\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- **North America** – Most abundant material from the Morrison Formation (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Montana).  \n- **Europe** – Specimens from the late Jurassic Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania (historically considered “African” but part of the same Gondwanan fauna) and from the Upper Jurassic of the United Kingdom (e.g., the Oxford Clay).  \n- **Asia** – Isolated teeth and fragmentary bones reported from the Early Cretaceous of Japan and China, though these are more controversial.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n- Camptosaurus was a medium‑to‑large, bipedal‑to‑quadrupedal ornithopod. Its forelimbs were robust and could be used to support the body when walking on all fours, while the hindlimbs were longer and built for faster bipedal locomotion.  \n- The skull was low and relatively flat, about 60 cm long, with a beak‑like dentary at the front and a row of cheek teeth adapted for grinding. The teeth were leaf‑shaped, with prominent ridges and a coarse enamel surface.  \n- The neck was moderately flexible, and the tail was long, muscular, and likely used as a counterbalance during bipedal running.  \n- The body was covered in scaly skin; some specimens preserve impressions suggesting a thin covering of simple filamentous “feathers” or proto‑feathers along the back and limbs, similar to what is known from later iguanodontians.  \n- The hand possessed five digits; the outer three bore large, hoof‑like claws, while the inner two were reduced, a condition that foreshadows the derived thumb spike of later iguanodontids.\n\n**Fossil Record & Specimens**  \n- Over 20 skeletons, ranging from nearly complete skulls to partial postcranial elements, have been catalogued from the Morrison Formation. Notable specimens include the “Morrison Camptosaurus” (CM 113) from the Dinosaur National Monument and the “Red Canyon Camptosaurus” (UCMP 101124).  \n- The holotype of *Camptosaurus dispar* (YPM 1885) is a partial skull and neck vertebrae discovered in Utah in 1878.  \n- Additional material from the Tendaguru Beds in Tanzania (e.g., the “Germanic” specimens collected by the German‑Tanzanian Expedition, 1909‑1913) extends the known geographic range.  \n- The genus has historically been a “wastebasket” for various ornithopod fragments, but modern phylogenetic work now recognizes at least two valid species: *C. dispar* (North America) and *C. lambei* (Europe), with possible late‑Cretaceous species *C. aphanoecetes* from the Barremian of Utah.\n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous. The leaf‑shaped, highly wear‑resistant cheek teeth indicate a diet of coarse, fibrous plant material such as cycads, conifers, ferns, and possibly early flowering plants (angiosperms) in the later part of its range.  \n- Tooth wear patterns suggest a combination of cropping low vegetation with the beak and then grinding it in the mouth, similar to modern herbivorous mammals.  \n- Gut capacity is inferred to have been large, enabling fermentation of plant matter, which aligns with its relatively massive body size.\n\n**Paleoenvironment**  \n- In the Morrison Formation, Camptosaurus inhabited flood‑plain ecosystems dominated by river channels, oxbow lakes, and seasonal wet–dry cycles. Vegetation included dense conifer forests, horsetail stands, and open fern meadows.  \n- Climate was semi‑arid to subhumid, with warm temperatures year‑round and pronounced wet seasons that supported lush growth along watercourses.  \n- The fauna coexisted with large sauropods (e.g., *Apatosaurus*, *Diplodocus*), other ornithopods (*Dryosaurus*, *Iguanodon*‑like forms), theropods (e.g., *Allosaurus*, *Ceratosaurus*), and early crocodylomorphs.  \n- In the Tendaguru beds, the landscape was similarly a coastal lowland with mangrove‑like vegetation, seasonal rivers, and a mix of marine‑influenced deposits, indicating Camptosaurus could also thrive in more humid, near‑shore environments.  \n\n**Summary**  \nCamptosaurus was a versatile, medium‑sized ornithopod that bridged the gap between early bipedal herbivores and the later, more derived iguanodontians and hadrosaurs. Its robust build, adaptable locomotion, and dental apparatus allowed it to exploit a range of Late Jurassic to early Cretaceous habitats across what is now North America, Europe, and parts of Africa, making it one of the better‑known and ecologically successful herbivores of its time.",

    "output": "**Carcharodontosaurus Overview**  \n\n**Size**  \n- Length: approximately 12–13 meters (40–43 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: about 3.5 meters (11.5 ft).  \n- Estimated weight: 6–8 metric tonnes.  \n- Skull length around 1.6 meters (5.2 ft), housing massive, blade‑like teeth.\n\n**Period Range**  \n- Lived during the middle Cretaceous, specifically the Cenomanian stage, roughly 100 to 93 million years ago.\n\n**Fossil Locations**  \n- Primary discoveries in the Sahara region of Niger (the Sahara Megalopolis formation).  \n- Additional fragmentary specimens reported from Morocco (Kem Kem beds) and possibly Algeria, indicating a broader distribution across what was then the northern part of the African continent.\n\n**Physical Description**  \nCarcharodontosaurus was a giant, bipedal theropod with a body plan similar to other large “carcharodontosaurid” predators. Its skull resembled a massive, low‑set skull of *Allosaurus* but far larger, equipped with serrated, laterally compressed teeth up to 15 cm long, ideal for slicing flesh. The jaws could open widely, and the dentition shows a distinctive “shark‑tooth” pattern, which gave the genus its name (“shark‑toothed lizard”).  \n\nThe neck was muscular and flexible, supporting a relatively short but heavily built torso. Forelimbs were proportionally short but robust, ending in three-fingered hands with powerful claws. The hind limbs were columnar, bearing weight on massive femurs and tibiae, allowing the animal to move with a gait capable of both rapid bursts and sustained walking. The tail was long and stiffened by elongated chevrons, acting as a counter‑balance for the massive head.\n\n**Fossil Records**  \n- The first and most complete specimen (a partial skull and some post‑cranial elements) was excavated in the 1990s near the town of Gadoufaoua, Niger, and described in 1996.  \n- Subsequent finds include isolated teeth, vertebrae, and limb fragments from the Kem Kem Group in Morocco, which have been attributed to the same species based on dental and vertebral morphology.  \n- The fossil material is generally fragmentary, but the skull bones (premaxilla, maxilla, dentary) provide the clearest diagnostic features.  \n- No complete skeleton has yet been recovered, so reconstructions rely on comparisons with better‑known carcharodontosaurids such as *Giganotosaurus* and *Mapusaurus*.\n\n**Diet Description**  \nA top-level apex predator, Carcharodontosaurus preyed upon the large herbivorous dinosaurs that shared its ecosystem. Likely targets included:  \n- Sauropods such as *Fitzgueraldia* and *Rebbachisaurus* (mid‑sized, herd‑living sauropods).  \n- Large ornithopods and iguanodontians that roamed the floodplains.  \n- Possibly other theropods in opportunistic or territorial encounters.  \n\nIts tooth morphology—large, laterally compressed, serrated edges—indicates a slicing feeding strategy, capable of delivering deep, lacerating wounds. Bite‑force estimates suggest it could crush bone, and wear patterns on teeth imply repeated processing of tough, meat‑rich carcasses.\n\n**Environmental Description**  \nDuring the Cenomanian, the region that is now the Sahara was a warm, semi‑arid to subtropical landscape dominated by extensive river systems, braided floodplains, and seasonal lakes. The climate featured a pronounced wet season, fostering lush vegetation along watercourses, interspersed with drier open plains.  \n\nFlora comprised conifers, early flowering plants (angiosperms), cycads, and ferns, providing abundant browse for herbivores. The mosaic of river deltas and floodplain forests created diverse habitats, supporting a rich assemblage of dinosaurs, crocodilians, pterosaurs, and early mammals. Carcharodontosaurus occupied the apex niche within this dynamic ecosystem, hunting across open plains and using riverbanks as ambush sites.  \n\nOverall, Carcharodontosaurus represents one of the largest predatory dinosaurs known from Africa, a formidable hunter adapted to a vibrant, water‑rich Cretaceous world.",

    "output": "Carnotaurus (meaning “meat-eating bull”) is a theropod dinosaur known from the Late Cretaceous of South America.  \n\nSize:  \n- Length: about 7.5 to 9 meters (25–30 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2.5 meters (8 ft).  \n- Estimated weight: 1.5 to 2.5 tonnes, depending on the individual’s build.\n\nPeriod range:  \n- Lived during the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 71 to 69 million years ago.\n\nFossil locations:  \n- The most complete specimens have been recovered from the Huincul Formation in the Neuquén Province of north‑western Argentina.  \n- Additional isolated bones and fragments have been found in the same formation and in nearby Cerro Lisandro and Cerro Barcino areas, all within Patagonia.\n\nPhysical description:  \n- Carnotaurus possessed a short, deep skull with a pair of prominent, horn‑like swellings above the eyes, giving it a bull‑like appearance.  \n- Its jaws were lined with serrated, laterally compressed teeth adapted for slicing flesh.  \n- The forelimbs were extremely reduced, even shorter than those of Tyrannosaurus, with only two functional fingers.  \n- The body was built for speed: a lightweight, aerodynamic torso, long powerful hind limbs, and a stiff tail that acted as a counter‑balance.  \n- Skin impressions indicate a mosaic of small, non‑overlapping scales, with larger, keeled scutes running along the dorsal midline, especially near the hips and tail.  \n- The tail ended in a “thickened” distal segment that may have helped in rapid directional changes.\n\nFossil records:  \n- The holotype (specimen MUCPv-162) consists of a nearly complete skull, partial vertebral column, pelvis and limb elements, discovered in 1988.  \n- A more complete skeleton (specimen MPCA-PV-796) recovered in the early 1990s includes a largely articulated skull, fore‑ and hind‑limbs, and most of the vertebral series, providing the basis for most reconstructions.  \n- To date, fewer than a dozen fairly complete specimens have been documented, making Carnotaurus one of the better‑known carcharodontosaurids despite the limited material.  \n- Rare isolated teeth and vertebrae have been reported from other Maastrichtian sites in Patagonia, suggesting a broader but still regionally confined distribution.\n\nDiet description:  \n- Carnotaurus was a top predator, primarily a carnivore. Its robust, blade‑like teeth and strong jaw muscles indicate it could deliver powerful bites to subdue medium‑sized herbivores such as iguanodontians, small titanosaurs, and possibly ornithopods.  \n- The reduced forelimbs suggest it relied on its massive head and neck to grasp and deliver killing blows, perhaps using a “bite‑and‑shake” technique similar to that inferred for other large theropods.  \n- There is indirect evidence (tooth marks on hadrosaurid bones from the same formation) that Carnotaurus may have scavenged opportunistically.\n\nEnvironment description:  \n- The Huincul Formation represents a semi‑arid to arid floodplain environment during the Maastrichtian.  \n- The landscape featured braided river channels, occasional lakes, and expanses of low‑lying vegetation dominated by conifers, ferns, and early flowering plants.  \n- Seasonal rainfall produced periodic flooding, depositing the fine sandstones and mudstones that now preserve the fossils.  \n- This setting supported a diverse fauna: large herbivorous sauropods (e.g., Argentinosaurus relatives), smaller ornithopods, ankylosaurs, and a variety of crocodyliforms, pterosaurs, and early mammals, providing ample prey for an apex predator like Carnotaurus.  \n\nOverall, Carnotaurus was a fast, heavily built predatory theropod adapted to the open, river‑driven plains of Late Cretaceous Patagonia, where it occupied the role of one of the top terrestrial hunters of its time.",

    "output": "Caudipteryx  \nSize: Caudipteryx was a small, bird‑like theropod, measuring about 1 meter (3.3 feet) in total length from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail. Its body mass has been estimated at roughly 2–3 kilograms (4.5–6.6 lb), comparable to a modern turkey.\n\nPeriod range: The genus lived during the Early Cretaceous, specifically in the Aptian age, approximately 125 to 120 million years ago.\n\nFossil locations: All known specimens come from the Yixian Formation in Liaoning Province, northeastern China. This lager‑stätte has yielded several well‑preserved individuals, including complete skeletons and some with feather impressions.\n\nPhysical description: Caudipteryus (the type species) possessed a compact, lightweight skeleton with a short, deep skull, a beak‑like snout, and reduced dentition limited to a few small teeth in the back of the mouth. The forelimbs were relatively short but bore a row of simple, symmetrical pennaceous feathers extending from the wrist to the tip of the hand, forming a modest wing‑like surface. The hind limbs were long and sturdy, terminating in bird‑like, curved claws. A fan of short, fluffy feathers covered the back and tail, giving the animal a feathered appearance unlike many contemporaneous non‑avian dinosaurs. The tail was short and stiff, supported by elongated vertebral processes (chevrons) that likely helped balance the animal during rapid runs.\n\nFossil records: Since the first discovery in 1998, more than a dozen Caudipteryx specimens have been recovered, some articulated and some preserved in three dimensions. The most famous specimen (IVPP V13371) retains soft‑tissue impressions that reveal the arrangement of the plumage. Additional finds include isolated limbs and partial skeletons that have helped clarify growth stages, showing that juveniles had proportionally longer tails and fewer feathers than adults.\n\nDiet: The dentition and jaw mechanics suggest a primarily omnivorous diet. The reduced teeth and beak indicate that Caudipteryx could crop vegetation, seeds, and fibrous plant parts, while the presence of small, conical teeth and the ability to grasp prey imply it also consumed insects, small vertebrates, and possibly small lizards. Stomach contents preserved in one specimen contained fragments of plant material and beetle exoskeletons, confirming this mixed feeding habit.\n\nEnvironment: Caudipteryx inhabited the lush, volcanic‑influenced floodplains of the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota. The landscape was a mosaic of lakes, ponds, and dense conifer‑and ginkgo‑dominated forests interspersed with open meadows. A temperate climate with distinct wet and dry seasons promoted abundant insect life and diverse plant communities, providing ample foraging opportunities for a small, agile omnivore. Periodic volcanic eruptions deposited ash layers that rapidly buried organisms, creating the exceptional preservation seen in the Yixian Formation.",

    "output": "Cedarpelta (Cedarpelta colei) – a basal ankylosaurian from the Early Late Cretaceous of North America  \n\nSize  \n- Length: approximately 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the shoulder: about 1.5 metres (5 ft).  \n- Estimated mass: 2–3 tonnes (4 400–6 600 lb).  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Lived during the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, roughly 95–100 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All confirmed specimens come from the Cedar Mountain Formation in northeastern Utah, United States, specifically the Mussentuchit Member.  \n- Isolated osteoderms and fragments have also been reported from nearby localities within the same formation, but no additional confirmed sites outside Utah are known.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Body covered by a mosaic of bony plates (osteoderms) of varying size, including large, flattened plates along the back and smaller keeled nodules on the limbs.  \n- Unlike later ankylosaurids, Cedarpelta possessed a relatively short, unclubbed tail; the distal caudal vertebrae are robust but lack the enlarged terminal osteoderms that form a true club.  \n- The skull is low and broad, with a pronounced brow ridge, small eye sockets, and a beak‑like rostral tip.  \n- Prominent shoulder spikes project laterally from the scapular region, giving the animal a distinctive “spiked shoulder” appearance.  \n- Limb bones are stout and columnar, supporting a heavy, quadrupedal stance.  \n\nFossil record details  \n- The holotype (USNM 557432) consists of a partial skull roof, several dorsal vertebrae, a partial pelvis, a fragmentary scapulocoracoid, and a series of articulated osteoderms.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated limb elements, tail vertebrae, and dozens of individual osteoderms recovered from the same stratigraphic horizon.  \n- The specimens are well preserved, showing fine surface sculpturing on the armor and clear articulation surfaces, allowing researchers to reconstruct the basic armor layout and infer muscle attachment sites.  \n\nDiet description  \n- As a herbivore, Cedarpelta would have used its beak‑like snout to crop low‑lying vegetation.  \n- Dental microwear and comparative anatomy suggest a diet of ferns, cycads, and possibly soft‑leafed conifers that grew in the flood‑plain environment.  \n- The lack of extensive chewing surfaces points to a feeding strategy based on stripping foliage rather than grinding tough, fibrous plants.  \n\nEnvironmental context  \n- The Cedar Mountain Formation during the Cenomanian was a semi‑arid to sub‑humid floodplain with meandering river channels, seasonal wet periods, and occasional lake deposits.  \n- Vegetation consisted of mixed assemblages of ferns, horsetails, low conifers, and early flowering plants (angiosperms), providing ample browse for large herbivores.  \n- The region supported a diverse dinosaur fauna, including iguanodontians, early tyrannosauroids, and other armored dinosaurs, indicating a complex ecosystem with multiple ecological niches.  \n- Periodic volcanic ash falls contributed to the fine‑grained sediments that preserved Cedarpelta’s armor and skeletal elements in remarkable detail.

    "output": "Centrosaurus – Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 5–6 metres (16–20 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2 metres (6.5 ft).  \n- Estimated mass: 1.5–2 tonnes.  \n\nGeological period  \n- Late Cretaceous, Campanian stage.  \n- Age range: approximately 76 to 73 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- Primarily the western Canadian interior, especially the Dinosaur Provincial Park and the Oldman and Two Medicine Formations of Alberta.  \n- Additional material has been reported from southern Alberta and from the Judith River and Two Medicine Formations of Montana, USA.  \n- Rare finds have also turned up in the Kootenay region of British Columbia.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- A large, robust ceratopsian with a broad, square‑shaped frill edged with a series of blunt, hooked spikes.  \n- A single, forward‑pointing nasal horn about 15–20 cm (6–8 in) long.  \n- A beaked mouth adapted for cropping vegetation, and a series of small, leaf‑shaped cheek teeth in the dental battery.  \n- Strong forelimbs ending in five‑digit hands, a sturdy torso, and relatively short hind limbs supporting a massive body.  \n- Skin impressions suggest a coat of small, bony scutes covering the neck and frill.  \n\nFossil record and significance  \n- Over 300 skulls and dozens of partial skeletons have been recovered, making Centrosaurus one of the best‑known ceratopsians.  \n- The abundance of specimens in a single horizon at sites like the Dinosaur Provincial Park suggests that the species lived in large herds and that mass death assemblages were caused by flooding events or drought‑related die‑offs.  \n- Bonebeds contain individuals of various ages, from juveniles to fully mature adults, providing insight into growth patterns and social structure.  \n\nDiet  \n- Strictly herbivorous.  The beak and the dental battery were suited to shearing tough, fibrous plants.  \n- Likely fed on low‑lying ferns, cycads, and the foliage of coniferous trees, as well as the tips of horsetails and early flowering plants that were common in Campanian floodplains.  \n- The wide, tooth‑filled jaws allowed for repetitive chewing, grinding plant material before swallowing.  \n\nEnvironment (habitat)  \n- Lived in a warm, temperate to subtropical climate with pronounced seasonal rainfalls.  \n- The region was dominated by river‑driven floodplains, meandering streams, and occasional coastal deltas.  \n- Vegetation consisted of a mix of conifer forests, open fern‑rich understories, and patches of low‑lying shrubs and horsetails, providing abundant food sources.  \n- Frequent seasonal flooding created lush, nutrient‑rich soils, supporting large herds of herbivores and a diverse predator community (e.g., tyrannosaurids and dromaeosaurids).  \n\nIn summary, Centrosaurus was a medium‑sized, horned herbivore that thrived in the floodplain ecosystems of western North America during the late Cretaceous, leaving an exceptionally rich fossil record that illuminates its biology, social behavior, and the environments it inhabited.",

    "output": "**Ceratosaurus – Species Overview**\n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 5.5–6.5 metres (18–21 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hip: roughly 1.2 metres (4 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 600–1,000 kg (1,300–2,200 lb).  \n\n**Geological Period**  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic, approximately 165 to 150 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- North America: Morrison Formation (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Montana, Oklahoma).  \n- Africa: Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania.  \n- Europe: Tendaguru‑related deposits in Portugal and the UK (e.g., the Purbeck Limestone).  \n- Rare finds also reported from the Middle Jurassic of China (possible early representatives).  \n\n**Physical Description**  \nCeratosaurus was a medium‑sized theropod with a deep, low‑snouted skull. Its most distinctive feature was a prominent nasal horn that projected forward from the tip of the snout, a pair of small supra‑orbital “hornlets” above the eyes, and a short, bony frill extending along the mid‑line of the neck. The skull was heavily ornamented with thickened bone and bore numerous pits, suggesting a keratinous covering.  \n\nThe dentition consisted of laterally compressed, serrated teeth suited for slicing flesh, but the anterior teeth were slightly more conical, indicating a capacity to grasp slippery prey. Its forelimbs were relatively short, bearing three-fingered hands with strong claws. The hind limbs were long and robust, ending in sharp, curved claws that would have aided in pursuit and capture of prey. The tail was stiffened by elongated neural spines, providing balance during rapid locomotion. Skin impressions suggest a covering of small, non‑overlapping scales, with possible larger scutes along the back and tail.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- Over 30 articulated and partial skeletons have been recovered, the most complete being the \"Cave of the Red Hands\" specimen from Utah (USNM 4739).  \n- Isolated teeth, vertebrae, and cranial elements are common in Morrison mudstone beds, indicating that Ceratosaurus was relatively abundant in its ecosystems.  \n- The African material (e.g., the “Tendaguru Ceratosaurus”) includes a nearly complete skull and partial post‑cranial skeleton, confirming the genus’ wide geographic distribution.  \n- Histological studies of bone thin sections show rapid growth rates, consistent with an active, predator lifestyle.  \n\n**Diet**  \nCeratosaurus was a carnivore and likely an opportunistic predator. Its jaw mechanics and serrated teeth were adapted for a flesh‑tearing bite. Evidence from tooth wear patterns and coprolites (fossilized feces) containing bone fragments indicates it fed on medium‑sized ornithischians such as Dryosaurus and Camptosaurus, as well as juvenile sauropods and other theropods. The forward‑projecting nasal horn may have been used in intraspecific combat or to inflict wounds on prey, though its exact function remains debated.  \n\n**Environmental Context**  \nDuring the Late Jurassic, the regions where Ceratosaurus fossils are found were dominated by semi‑arid floodplains interspersed with river channels, lakes, and occasional swamps. The Morrison Formation represents a mosaic of habitats: open grassy plains (early grasses), coniferous forests, and fern‑rich understories. Seasonal monsoonal rains created fertile river valleys that supported abundant herbivorous dinosaurs, providing a steady prey base for predators like Ceratosaurus. The climate was warm temperate to subtropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons. In the African Tendaguru region, similar floodplain environments existed, with volcanic ash layers indicating periodic volcanic activity that contributed to rapid burial and exceptional fossil preservation.  \n\nOverall, Ceratosaurus was a well‑adapted, mid‑sized apex predator of Late Jurassic ecosystems, distinguished by its iconic nasal horn and broad geographic range across the ancient supercontinent of Laurasia and parts of Gondwana.",

    "output": "**Cetiosauriscus** – a mid‑Jurassic sauropod that roamed what is now central‑eastern England.\n\n**Size**  \nAdult individuals are estimated to have reached 15–17 metres (≈50–55 ft) in total length and to have weighed roughly 7–10 tonnes. The animal possessed a long neck and tail, a relatively low‑set body, and robust limb bones capable of supporting its massive weight.\n\n**Geologic time range**  \nCetiosauriscus lived during the Middle Jurassic, specifically the Bathonian stage, about 168–166 million years ago.\n\n**Fossil localities**  \nThe type specimen and most of the material come from the Oxford Clay and the Great Oolite Group of the Yorkshire and Leicestershire regions of England. Key localities include:\n\n* Kirtlington Quarry (Oxfordshire) – Oxford Clay, Bathonian.  \n* Leighton Buzzard (Bedfordshire) – Great Oolite, Bathonian.  \n* Leeds area (West Yorkshire) – the historic “Leeds” site that gave the species its name.\n\n**Physical description**  \n- **Skull:** No complete skull is known; the few cranial fragments suggest a relatively small head compared with the body, typical of basal sauropods.  \n- **Neck:** Eleven to twelve cervical vertebrae, elongated and slightly opisthocoelous (convex front, concave rear), giving the neck a moderate curvature.  \n- **Back and sacrum:** Dorsal vertebrae display tall neural arches and robust centra; the sacrum is composed of five fused vertebrae that articulate with a broad, shallow iliac blade.  \n- **Tail:** Long, whip‑like caudal series with a series of gradually tapering vertebrae, ending in a thin, flexible tip.  \n- **Limbs:** Massive columnar femora and tibiae with thick cortical walls; the forelimb is slightly shorter than the hindlimb, indicating a slightly inclined posture.  \n- **Armor/skin:** No osteoderms have been found; the integument was likely covered in simple, filamentous skin similar to that inferred for other basal sauropods.\n\n**Fossil record**  \n- **Holotype (BMNH R 7514):** partial vertebral column (cervicals, dorsals, sacrum), a few rib fragments and pelvic elements, housed in the Natural History Museum, London.  \n- **Referred specimens:** Several additional vertebrae and limb bone fragments (NHMUK R 3660‑R 3663, R 3670‑R 3672) from nearby Bathonian deposits, catalogued in the same museum and in the Leeds City Museum.  \n- **Historical notes:** First described by von Huene in 1927 as *Cetiosaurus leedsii* and later reassigned to its own genus, *Cetiosauriscus*, in 1995 after detailed comparative work highlighted distinctive vertebral morphology.\n\n**Diet**  \nLike all sauropods, *Cetiosauriscus* was a strict herbivore. Its long neck allowed it to browse vegetation at both low and mid‑canopy heights. The Middle Jurassic flora of England consisted mainly of conifers (e.g., *Araucarioxylon*), cycads, bennettitaleans, ferns, and horsetails. Dental evidence from related taxa suggests a peg‑shaped, leaf‑stripping tooth morphology, implying that *Cetiosauriscus* fed on soft foliage, fern fronds, and possibly the tender shoots of coniferous trees.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Bathonian, the region was a low‑lying coastal plain bordering a shallow epicontinental sea. The landscape comprised meandering river floodplains, lush riparian forests, and lagoonal marshes. Climate was warm and humid, with high seasonal rainfall supporting abundant vegetation. Periodic marine incursions left behind the marine‑rich Oxford Clay, while the overlying Great Oolite represents fluvial‑to‑deltaic sands and mudstones. *Cetiosauriscus* would have moved across open floodplain vegetation, occasionally venturing near water bodies where its massive size could aid in thermoregulation and predator avoidance.",

Estimates of its mass vary, but most recent calculations put the animal at 10–15 tonnes.\n\nPeriod range  \nThe genus lived during the Middle Jurassic, specifically the Bajocian to Bathonian ages, about 170 to 166 million years ago.\n\nFossil locations  \nThe first and most complete material comes from the Great Oolite Group of England, especially the Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire areas. Additional fragments have been found in the Dockum Succession of the United Kingdom and isolated teeth and vertebrae from the Middle Jurassic strata of France and Portugal have also been attributed to Cetiosaurus.\n\nPhysical description  \nCetiosaurus possessed the classic sauropod body plan: a long, serpentine neck of 10–12 cervical vertebrae, a massive barrel‑shaped torso, and a long, whip‑like tail. The limbs were columnar and robust, supporting its great weight. The skull is poorly known, but the few recovered cranial elements suggest a relatively small head with a blunt snout, nostrils set low on the snout, and simple, leaf‑shaped teeth suited for stripping vegetation. The skin likely bore a mosaic of small, raised scales, as inferred from related sauropods.\n\nFossil record  \nThe type species, *Cetiosaurus oxoniensis*, was named in 1841 from a partial skeleton discovered near Oxford. Since then more than a dozen specimens have been recovered, ranging from isolated vertebrae to near‑complete postcranial skeletons. The most complete find, the “Rutland specimen,” includes a near‑complete dorsal series, pelvis, and portions of the fore‑ and hind‑limbs, allowing scientists to reconstruct the animal’s overall proportions. The abundance of vertebral material has made *Cetiosaurus* an important reference for Middle Jurassic sauropod anatomy.\n\nDiet description  \nAs a herbivore, *Cetiosaurus* fed on low‑ to mid‑height vegetation. Its leaf‑shaped, spatulate teeth were adapted for cropping ferns, cycads, conifers, and early gymnosperm shrubs that dominated Jurassic woodlands. The long neck would have allowed it to browse a relatively wide feeding envelope, reaching both ground‑level foliage and higher branches without moving its massive body.\n\nEnvironmental context  \nDuring the Middle Jurassic, the regions where *Cetiosaurus* lived were part of a warm, humid flood‑plain system dotted with rivers, lakes, and shallow coastal lagoons. The climate was subtropical, with abundant rainfall supporting lush, dense forests of conifers, ginkgos, horsetails, and seed ferns. Soils were often rich in organic material, and periodic volcanic activity contributed to rapid burial of carcasses, enhancing fossil preservation. This mosaic of wetland and forest habitats provided ample food sources and a relatively predator‑free niche for a giant, slow‑moving sauropod such as *Cetiosaurus*.",

    "output": "Chaoyangsaurus (Chaoyangsaurus youngi) is an early, basal ceratopsian known from a single, relatively complete specimen discovered in northeastern China.  \n\n**Size**  \n- Total length: roughly 1.2–1.5 metres (4–5 ft).  \n- Shoulder height: about 0.7 metres (2.3 ft).  \n- Estimated body mass: 20–30 kilograms (45–65 lb).  \n\n**Geological age (period range)**  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic, most likely the Oxfordian stage, approximately 165 to 159 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil locality**  \n- The holotype was recovered from the Upper Jurassic deposits of the Tuchengzi (also reported as the Yixian) Formation near Chaoyang in Liaoning Province, China.  \n- The site is part of the “Jehol” palaeontological province, famous for its exquisitely preserved vertebrate fossils.  \n\n**Physical description**  \n- Skull: modestly sized, about 15 cm long, with a short, low frill that lacked the large fenestrae seen in later ceratopsians. No true horns were present; the brow and nasal regions are smooth.  \n- Beak: a keratin‑covered rostral bone forming a parrot‑like beak, suited for cropping vegetation.  \n- Dentition: small, leaf‑shaped cheek teeth arranged in rows, typical of early ceratopsians.  \n- Body: slender, bipedal‑capable torso with relatively long hind‑limbs; fore‑limbs were shorter but robust, terminating in five‑digit hands with strong claws.  \n- Tail: moderately long and stiffened by ossified tendons, probably used for balance.  \n\n**Fossil record**  \n- Holotype: IVPP V12093, consisting of a partial skull (including the rostral, premaxillae, and some frill bones) and an associated partial postcranial skeleton (vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, and limb elements).  \n- Discovered in 1994, described formally in 1999 by Zhao Xijin and colleagues.  \n- To date no additional complete specimens have been found, but isolated teeth and fragmentary limb bones from the same formation have been tentatively referred to Chaoyangsaurus.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous. The beak and leaf‑shaped cheek teeth indicate a diet of low‑standing vegetation such as ferns, horsetails, seed ferns, and the tender shoots of conifers and cycads.  \n- Dental wear patterns suggest a primarily cropping and small‑leaf chewing feeding style rather than heavy grinding.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- The Tuchengzi Formation records a volcanically active floodplain environment with alternating fluvial sandstones, mudstones, and fine volcanic ash layers.  \n- Climate was warm‑temperate with pronounced seasonal rainfall, supporting a mix of coniferous forests, ginkgoes, and open fern‑rich understories.  \n- Lakes and ponds dotted the landscape, providing water sources for dinosaurs and a habitat for aquatic organisms.  \n- Contemporary fauna included early mammals (e.g., multituberculates), small theropods, other early ornithischians, pterosaurs, and a diverse assemblage of insects and fish, indicating a relatively rich ecosystem.  \n\nIn summary, Chaoyangsaurus was a small, early‑branching ceratopsian that inhabited the lush, volcanically influenced floodplains of Late Jurassic Liaoning. Its anatomy reflects an herbivorous lifestyle focused on low‑lying plants, and its fossil remains offer a valuable glimpse into the early evolutionary steps that later produced the iconic horned dinosaurs of the Cretaceous.",

    "output": "Chasmosaurus – Overview  \nThe genus Chasmosaurus is a ceratopsian dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, roughly between 77 and 73 million years ago. Its remains have been recovered primarily from the upper Campanian strata of what is now western North America, especially in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan and the U.S. state of Montana.\n\nSize  \n- Length: about 5 to 6 meters (16–20 feet) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 1.5 to 2 meters (5–6.5 feet).  \n- Weight: estimated 2 to 3 tonnes (4,400–6,600 lbs).\n\nPhysical description  \nChasmosaurus possessed the classic ceratopsian body plan: a large, sturdy quadrupedal frame, a short neck, and a massive skull. The skull could reach up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length and featured a broad frill that was edged with a series of long, low spikes or epoccipitals. Unlike some later ceratopsids, Chasmosaurus had relatively modest nasal and brow horns—generally a low, forward‑projecting nasal horn and a pair of modest brow horns that pointed upward and slightly outward. Its beak was sharp and shaped for cropping vegetation, and the cheek teeth were leaf‑shaped, suitable for grinding plant material. The body was covered in scaly skin; possible filamentous structures have been suggested but are not confirmed.\n\nFossil record  \n- The type species, *Chasmosaurus belli*, was named in 1914 from material discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta.  \n- Additional specimens have been found in the Two Medicine Formation (Montana) and the Oldman and Horseshoe Canyon formations (Alberta).  \n- Over 30 partial skeletons and numerous isolated skull elements have been recovered, providing a relatively good understanding of its cranial morphology and variation among individuals.  \n- Some of the most complete skulls (e.g., specimen AMNH 5454) illustrate the characteristic wide frill and the arrangement of epoccipitals, helping to distinguish Chasmosaurus from later, larger chasmosaurines such as *Triceratops*.\n\nDiet  \nChasmosaurus was a herbivore. Its dental batteries, consisting of tightly packed, continually replacing leaf‑shaped teeth, were adapted for processing fibrous, low‑nutrient vegetation. It likely fed on low‑lying to mid‑height plants such as ferns, cycads, conifers, and early flowering plants (angiosperms). The beak would have been used to snap off foliage, while the cheek teeth ground the material into a pulp suitable for digestion. Isotopic analyses of bone suggests a diet dominated by C3 plants typical of forested floodplains.\n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Campanian, the regions where Chasmosaurus fossils are found were part of a warm, humid coastal plain within the Western Interior Seaway’s margin. The landscape comprised river channels, floodplain mudstones, and abundant swampy vegetation. Forests of conifers, araucarian pines, and ginkgoes intermingled with fern thickets and open meadows of early angiosperms. Seasonal rainfall created a mosaic of wet and drier patches, supporting a diverse assemblage of dinosaurs, crocodilians, turtles, and early mammals. The presence of large herbivores like Chasmosaurus indicates plentiful plant resources, while the wide frill may have played a role in thermoregulation or visual display within this visually complex environment.",
