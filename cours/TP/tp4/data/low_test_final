    "output": "Abelisaurus is a medium‑sized theropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous, roughly between 85 and 70 million years ago. Its remains have been recovered from the Neuquén Province of north‑western Argentina, specifically from the Portezuelo and Cerro Lisandro formations of the Neuquén Group, which are part of the larger Patagonian fossil record.\n\nSize  \nAdult Abelisaurus individuals are estimated to have reached about 7–8 metres (23–26 feet) in total length, with a height at the hips of roughly 2 metres (6.5 feet). Body mass is thought to have been in the range of 800–1 000 kilograms (1,800–2,200 lb).\n\nPhysical description  \nThe skull of Abelisaurus was short, deep, and heavily built, lacking the large fenestrae (openings) seen in many other theropods. Its jaws were lined with robust, laterally compressed teeth that were ideal for slicing flesh. The forelimbs were extremely reduced, even more so than in the related Carnotaurus, ending in a single functional digit. The neck and torso were muscular, supporting a powerful tail that acted as a counter‑balance. The animal’s skin is inferred to have been covered with small, non‑overlapping scales, and some related abelisaurids show evidence of low, bony ridges along the back, suggesting Abelisaurus may have possessed a modest dorsal crest or ornamentation.\n\nFossil records  \nThe type specimen (MLP‑84‑VII‑3‑1) consists of a partial skull roof, several vertebrae, and fragments of the pelvis and hind limbs. Since its discovery in 1985, additional isolated bones—mostly vertebrae, ribs, and limb elements—have been assigned to the genus, expanding knowledge of its anatomy but still leaving many parts of the skeleton unknown. The scarcity of complete material makes Abelisaurus one of the more fragmentarily known members of the Abelisauridae family.\n\nDiet  \nAs a carnivorous apex predator, Abelizaurus likely preyed on medium‑sized herbivorous dinosaurs that shared its environment, such as titanosaurian sauropods in their juvenile stages, ornithopods, and possibly smaller theropods. Its strong bite force, combined with serrated, laterally compressed teeth, would have allowed it to deliver deep, flesh‑tearing wounds. The reduced forelimbs suggest that it relied primarily on its powerful jaws and neck muscles to subdue prey rather than grasping.\n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Late Cretaceous, the Neuquén Basin was a mosaic of floodplains, river channels, and semi‑arid scrubland. Seasonal rainfall created lush riparian zones along the rivers, supporting abundant vegetation and a diverse fauna. The climate was warm to temperate, with distinct wet and dry seasons. This setting provided ample hunting grounds for Abelisaurus, which could have stalked prey along riverbanks or ambushed animals near water sources. The presence of large sauropods, hadrosaur‑like ornithopods, and other theropods indicates a complex ecosystem in which Abelisaurus occupied the role of a top terrestrial predator.",

    "output": "Abrictosaurus – Overview  \n\nSize  \nAbrictosaurus was a small ornithischian dinosaur, measuring roughly 1.2 to 1.5 metres (4–5 ft) in length from snout to tail and standing about 0.6 m (2 ft) tall at the hips. Its body mass is estimated at 15–20 kg (33–44 lb), comparable to a medium‑sized dog.  \n\nGeological time range  \nThe species lived during the Early Jurassic, specifically the Hettangian to Sinemurian stages, about 199 to 190 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \nAll known specimens of Abrictosaurus have been recovered from the Upper Elliot Formation of southern Africa, chiefly from the Karoo Basin of South Africa (near the town of Lesotho’s border) and a few isolated finds in the Clarens Formation of the same region.  \n\nPhysical description  \nAbrictosaurus was a low‑slung, bipedal herbivore with a compact, robust skull. The skull was about 15 cm long, bearing a beak‑like premaxilla and a small, leaf‑shaped dentary tooth row. Unlike its later relatives, it possessed only a few cheek teeth (typically 3–4 per side) that were low‑crowned and slightly serrated, indicating a diet of soft vegetation. The body was covered in short, filamentous proto‑feathers or bristle‑like structures, as suggested by the presence of quill knobs on the forearm bones of the best‑preserved specimen. The forelimbs were short but bore five digits, the first being a small, possibly vestigial thumb. The hind limbs were long and powerful, ending in three-toed feet with blunt claws, well suited for rapid running. The tail was relatively short and stiffened by ossified tendons, providing balance during locomotion.  \n\nFossil record and specimens  \nOnly a handful of partial skeletons have been described, the most complete being the holotype (NHMUK R 5860) consisting of a partial skull, lower jaws, several vertebrae, portions of the pelvis, and both fore‑ and hind‑limb elements. Additional material includes isolated teeth, a few vertebral fragments, and a partial right hind limb recovered from the same stratigraphic horizon. The scarcity of material makes precise reconstructions difficult, but the available bones show a well‑ossified skeleton with no evidence of extensive pneumaticity.  \n\nDiet  \nAbrictosaurus was an herbivore that likely fed on low‑lying, soft vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and early coniferous shoots. The low, leaf‑shaped cheek teeth and the beak‑like front of the jaws suggest it could crop foliage and process it with a simple chewing motion. The limited number of cheek teeth indicates it did not need to grind tough, fibrous plants, supporting a diet of relatively tender plant parts.  \n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Early Jurassic, the region that is now the Karoo Basin was a semi‑arid floodplain with seasonal rainfall. The landscape featured river channels, mud‑flat deposits, and occasional volcanic ash layers, creating a mosaic of open scrubland, fern‑rich banks, and scattered coniferous woodlands. The climate was warm, with pronounced wet and dry seasons, supporting a diverse assemblage of early dinosaurs, basal sauropodomorphs, and small theropods. Abrictosaurus would have inhabited the understory of this environment, using its speed to escape predators and its beak to browse the abundant low vegetation.  \n\nIn summary, Abrictosaurus was a diminutive, early ornithischian that lived about 195 million years ago in what is now southern Africa. Its modest size, simple dentition, and bipedal agility reflect an adaptation to a niche of grazing on soft, low‑lying plants within a seasonally wet floodplain ecosystem.",

    "output": "Abrosaurus (meaning “delicate lizard”) is a relatively obscure sauropod from the Middle Jurassic of what is now western China.  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 12–14 metres (40–46 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height: roughly 3.5 m (11 ft) at the shoulder when the animal was on all fours.  \n- Mass: estimated 8–10 tonnes, comparable to a modern elephant.  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Lived during the Middle Jurassic, specifically the Bajocian to Bathonian stages, approximately 170–165 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known material comes from the Upper Shaximiao Formation in the Sichuan Basin, near the city of Zigong, Sichuan Province, China.  \n- Additional isolated teeth and vertebral fragments attributed to Abrosaurus have been reported from the lower part of the same formation in the neighboring Yunnan region.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Body plan typical of basal macronarian sauropods: a long neck with 13–14 cervical vertebrae, a relatively low, barrel‑shaped torso, and a robust, columnar limb structure.  \n- The skull is small in proportion to the body, with a short, blunt snout and a modestly developed nasal opening.  \n- Teeth are spoon‑shaped (spatulate) and low‑crowned, arranged in a relatively narrow dental battery, indicating a selective browsing habit.  \n- The dorsal vertebrae possess shallow pleurocoels (air‑filled cavities) suggesting a lightweight skeleton.  \n- Tail is moderately long, ending in a tapered tip; no evidence of a tail club or spikes.  \n- Skin impressions are unknown, but based on related sauropods, the body was likely covered with a mosaic of small, polygonal scales, possibly with occasional larger scutes along the flanks.  \n\nFossil records  \n- The holotype (IVPP V12345) consists of a partial skull, several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a fragmentary pelvis, and a few limb bones.  \n- Additional referred specimens include isolated caudal vertebrae (IVPP V12346) and a series of teeth (IVPP V12347).  \n- The material is relatively well preserved, allowing detailed study of the vertebral pneumaticity and dental morphology, but no complete skeleton has yet been recovered.  \n- Radiometric dating of volcanic ash layers within the Shaximiao Formation places the Abrosaurus-bearing strata at about 167 Ma.  \n\nDiet description  \n- The spatulate, low‑crowned teeth indicate a herbivorous diet focused on soft vegetation.  \n- Likely fed on low‑lying ferns, cycads, and the tender shoots of coniferous trees that grew in the understory.  \n- The relatively short neck compared with later sauropods suggests it fed at mid‑level heights (1–3 m above ground) rather than high canopy foliage.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \n- During the Middle Jurassic, the Sichuan Basin was a lush, semi‑arid floodplain interspersed with river channels, lakes, and seasonal wetlands.  \n- Climate was warm and humid, supporting extensive conifer‑dominated forests, abundant ferns, horsetails, and early gymnosperm shrubs.  \n- Periodic volcanic activity deposited ash layers that later became the tuffaceous horizons used for dating the formation.  \n- The ecosystem also hosted a variety of contemporaneous dinosaurs, such as the theropod Sinraptor, the stegosaurs Chungkingosaurus and Tuojiangosaurus, and smaller ornithopods, as well as early mammals, crocodilians, and abundant freshwater fish.  \n- Seasonal monsoonal rains would have created a dynamic landscape of mudflats and vegetated banks, providing abundant forage for large herbivores like Abrosaurus.  \n\nIn summary, Abrosaurus was a medium‑sized, mid‑jurassic macronarian sauropod adapted for selective browsing in a warm, vegetated floodplain environment of what is now southwestern China. Its relatively complete cranial and vertebral material makes it an important taxon for understanding the early evolution of the group that would later give rise to the giant titanosaurs of the Cretaceous.",

    "output": "Abydosaurus (Abydosaurus mcintoshi) is a relatively small, early‑Cretaceous sauropod known from the western United States.  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 12–14 meters (40–46 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 3 meters (10 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 7–9 tons.  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Early Cretaceous, specifically the Albian stage, approximately 105–100 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locality  \n- All known material comes from the Cedar Mountain Formation in eastern Utah, United States, near the town of Green River. The type specimen was recovered from the “Mussentuchit” member of the formation.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- As a basal titanosauriform, Abydosaurus possessed a relatively long neck and a modestly elongated tail.  \n- The skull is one of the most complete known for early Cretaceous sauropods, showing a low, broad snout with a short, rounded muzzle.  \n- Teeth are spoon‑shaped (spatulate) and arranged in a single row, typical of low‑browsing sauropods.  \n- The vertebrae are lightly pneumatic, with large internal chambers that reduced bone weight.  \n- Limb bones are robust but not as massive as those of later giant titanosaurs; the forelimbs are slightly shorter than the hind limbs, giving the animal a slightly inclined posture.  \n\nFossil record  \n- The holotype (USNM 538127) includes a partial skull, lower jaws, several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a partial pelvis, and a left hind limb.  \n- Additional referred material consists of isolated teeth, a few caudal vertebrae, and fragmentary limb elements recovered from the same stratigraphic horizon.  \n- The preservation is excellent for the skull, allowing detailed study of cranial anatomy and feeding mechanics, while the post‑cranial skeleton remains fragmentary.  \n\nDiet  \n- The spatulate teeth and low‑browsing skull shape indicate a diet of soft, low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and early angiosperm leaves.  \n- Wear patterns on the teeth suggest a primarily herbivorous diet with occasional ingestion of tougher plant material, but no evidence of omnivory.  \n\nEnvironmental context  \n- The Cedar Mountain Formation during the Albian was a semi‑arid floodplain with seasonal rivers and occasional lakes.  \n- Vegetation comprised a mix of conifers, ginkgophytes, ferns, and the emerging flowering plants that began to diversify in the Early Cretaceous.  \n- The climate was warm with pronounced wet and dry seasons, supporting a mosaic of open woodlands and riparian corridors.  \n- Abydosaurus shared its habitat with other dinosaurs such as the iguanodontian Iguanacolossus, the theropod Utahraptor, and various early ceratopsians, as well as crocodile‑like archosaurs and abundant freshwater fish.  \n\nOverall, Abydosaurus provides a rare glimpse into the early evolution of titanosauriform sauropods, illustrating how these giants adapted to the changing flora and climate of the Early Cretaceous western North American ecosystems.",

    "output": "Acantholipan is a relatively obscure ankylosaurian dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now northern Mexico.  \n\nSize  \nAdult individuals are estimated to have reached about 5 to 6 metres (16–20 ft) in length and stood roughly 1.5 metres (5 ft) tall at the hip. Their mass is thought to have been in the range of 2–3 tonnes, comparable to other medium‑sized ankylosaurs.  \n\nPeriod range  \nThe species is known from the Campanian to the early Maastrichtian, roughly 80 to 70 million years ago, placing it toward the end of the Cretaceous period.  \n\nFossil location  \nAll confirmed specimens of Acantholipan have been recovered from the Cerro del Pueblo Formation near the town of Monterrey in the state of Coahuila, Mexico. The formation is part of the larger Difunta Group, a sequence of fluvial and flood‑plain deposits that preserve a diverse assemblage of Late Cretaceous vertebrates.  \n\nPhysical description  \nAcantholipan possessed the classic ankylosaur armor: a broad, low‑slung body covered in rows of bony plates (osteoderms) that interlocked to form a protective shield. The most distinctive feature, reflected in its name (“spiny armor”), is a series of tall, conical spikes that project from the neck and shoulder region, giving the animal a somewhat “spiky” silhouette. The skull was relatively small, triangular, and heavily ornamented with a beak‑like rostrum and a pair of small, forward‑facing nostrils. Its limbs were stout and columnar, supporting its massive weight, while the tail ended in a modest club composed of fused vertebrae and additional armor plates, though the club was less developed than in later North American ankylosaurs such as Ankylosaurus.  \n\nFossil records  \nThe holotype, catalogued as CPC‑001, consists of a partial skull, several dorsal vertebrae, a series of well‑preserved osteoderms, and a fragmentary tail club. Additional referred material includes isolated armor plates, limb bones, and a few isolated teeth recovered from the same stratigraphic horizon. The preservation is generally good, with some specimens retaining surface texture that allows researchers to infer the arrangement of the dermal armor. To date, only a handful of individuals have been described, making Acantholipan one of the better‑known Mexican ankylosaurs but still a relatively rare taxon in the fossil record.  \n\nDiet description  \nLike other ankylosaurs, Acantholipan was a herbivore that fed on low‑lying vegetation. Its beak‑like mouth was adapted for cropping ferns, cycads, and the tough leaves of coniferous shrubs. The dentition consisted of small, leaf‑shaped cheek teeth with coarse enamel, suitable for grinding fibrous plant material. Microscopic wear patterns on the teeth suggest a diet dominated by coarse, abrasive foliage, possibly supplemented by occasional fruit or seed pods when available.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \nDuring the Late Cretaceous, the Cerro del Pueblo region was a warm, semi‑arid floodplain dotted with river channels, oxbow lakes, and seasonal wetlands. The climate was subtropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons that supported a mosaic of plant communities: open coniferous woodlands, dense fern thickets, and patches of flowering angiosperms beginning to diversify. The landscape also hosted a rich fauna, including hadrosaurid and ceratopsian herbivores, large theropods such as tyrannosaurids, and smaller dromaeosaurids. Periodic flooding deposited fine sand and mud, creating the sedimentary layers that now preserve the fossils. In this environment, Acantholipan would have moved slowly across the low vegetation, using its armor as protection against predators while foraging on the abundant ground‑level plants.",

    "output": "Acanthopholis (meaning “spiny scale”) is a small to medium‑sized ankylosaurian dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous.  \n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 3–4 metres (10–13 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height: roughly 1 metre (3 ft) at the shoulder.  \n- Weight: estimated 500–800 kg (1,100–1,800 lb).  \n\n**Geological time range**  \n- Early Cretaceous, specifically the Valanginian to Barremian stages, approximately 140–125 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil locations**  \n- The type specimens were recovered from the Lower Cretaceous Wealden Group of southern England, chiefly the Sussex and Kent areas.  \n- Additional fragmentary material has been reported from the Isle of Wight and from the Early Cretaceous deposits of Spain (though those specimens are often considered indeterminate ankylosaur remains).  \n\n**Physical description**  \n- Body covered by a dense armor of bony plates (osteoderms) that were keeled and bore prominent spikes, especially along the neck and flanks, giving the animal its “spiny” appearance.  \n- The skull was low and broad, with a beaked mouth and small, leaf‑shaped teeth suited for cropping vegetation.  \n- Limbs were short and robust, ending in broad, plantigrade feet with five toes, the inner toes bearing small, blunt claws.  \n- The tail was relatively short and lacked the large club seen in later ankylosaurs, but it was protected by a series of overlapping tail plates.  \n- Skin impressions suggest a covering of small, polygonal scutes interspersed with larger, pointed spikes.  \n\n**Fossil record**  \n- The holotype (NHMUK R 1635) consists of a partial skull roof, several dorsal osteoderms, and fragments of the pelvis.  \n- Additional specimens include isolated vertebrae, limb bones, and numerous isolated armor plates catalogued in the Natural History Museum, London, and the British Geological Survey collections.  \n- The material is fragmentary, which has led to some taxonomic debate; however, most researchers agree that the distinctive spiked osteoderms justify a separate genus.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous. The leaf‑shaped cheek teeth and beak indicate a diet of low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were abundant in the flood‑plain environments of the Wealden.  \n- The heavy armor suggests a low‑metabolism, slow‑moving lifestyle, relying on defensive protection rather than speed to avoid predators.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- Lived in a warm, semi‑arid to humid climate dominated by river valleys, floodplains, and coastal lagoons.  \n- The Wealden Group records a mosaic of habitats: riparian forests of conifers and ginkgos, open fern‑rich understories, and occasional swampy wetlands.  \n- Seasonal rainfall created periodic flooding, depositing the mudstones and sandstones that now preserve the fossils.  \n- Predators in the same ecosystem included early theropods such as Baryonyx and Eotyrannus, which would have posed a threat to juvenile Acanthopholis, reinforcing the need for heavy armor.  \n\nOverall, Acanthopholis was a modestly sized, heavily armored herbivore adapted to the varied, river‑dominated landscapes of Early Cretaceous southern England, using its spiked armor as a primary defense against the contemporary carnivorous dinosaurs.",

    "output": "Achelousaurus (Achelousaurus horneri) is a medium‑large centrosaurine ceratopsian that lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now the western United States.\n\nSize  \n- Length: about 5.5–6.0 metres (18–20 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2.0 m (6.5 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 2.5–3.5 tonnes, comparable to a modern bull.\n\nPeriod range  \n- Upper Campanian to early Maastrichtian, approximately 76 to 70 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Two Medicine Formation of north‑central Montana, USA.  \n- The type specimen (CMN 8800) and several additional skulls and post‑cranial elements come from the same stratigraphic horizon near the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and the area around the town of Bynum.\n\nPhysical description  \n- Achelousaurus possessed a broad, low skull typical of centrosaurines, measuring roughly 1.5 m (5 ft) in length.  \n- The frill was heavily ornamented with a series of large, flattened, knob‑like epoccipitals that formed a “spiky” margin, giving the animal its common name “spike‑back”.  \n- Unlike the more elongated nasal horn of its close relative Centrosaurus, Achelousaurus had a short, low nasal boss that was thickened and roughened, possibly used for in‑traspecific combat.  \n- The brow horns were modest, low and slightly curved upward.  \n- The body was robust, with a deep, barrel‑shaped torso, sturdy forelimbs ending in three‑toed hands, and powerful hind limbs supporting a semi‑quadrupedal stance.  \n- Skin impressions are lacking, but based on related ceratopsians it likely bore a covering of small, polygonal scales with possible keratinous spikes on the frill margin.\n\nFossil record  \n- The holotype consists of a nearly complete skull and partial post‑cranial skeleton.  \n- Additional material includes at least three more skulls, several isolated frill pieces, and numerous limb bones, allowing a fairly complete reconstruction of the skeleton.  \n- The Two Medicine Formation yields a relatively high concentration of centrosaurine fossils, indicating that Achelousaurus was a common component of the local fauna during the latest Campanian.  \n- No known specimens have been found outside the Two Medicine Formation, suggesting a geographically restricted range or a preservation bias.\n\nDiet description  \n- As a herbivore, Achelousaurus fed on low‑lying vegetation.  \n- Its beak was sharp and shearing, suitable for cropping ferns, cycads, and the tough leaves of coniferous trees.  \n- Dental batteries in the jaws consisted of hundreds of tightly packed teeth that formed a grinding surface, allowing the animal to process fibrous plant material efficiently.  \n- Isotopic analyses of tooth enamel indicate a diet dominated by C3 plants, consistent with the cool, moist climate of the Late Cretaceous interior of western North America.\n\nEnvironmental description  \n- The Two Medicine Formation during the Late Cretaceous represented a semi‑arid floodplain with seasonal precipitation.  \n- The landscape was a mosaic of river channels, oxbow lakes, and expansive mud‑flat plains interspersed with conifer forests, deciduous shrubs, and abundant fern understories.  \n- Volcanic ash layers indicate periodic volcanic activity in the region, contributing to fertile soils that supported diverse plant life.  \n- Achelousaurus shared its habitat with other dinosaurs such as the hadrosaurid Maiasaura, the tyrannosaurid Daspletosaurus, the ankylosaurid Edmontonia, and various theropods and small ornithischians.  \n- The climate was temperate to cool, with warm summers and cold winters, and the presence of large water bodies created a dynamic ecosystem that could sustain large herbivores like Achelousaurus.",

    "output": "Acheroraptor temertius – a small, agile dromaeosaurid that lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous.\n\nSize  \n- Adult length: about 1.5 – 2 metres (5–6.5 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 0.6 metres (2 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 15–20 kilograms (33–44 lb).  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Upper Campanian to early Maastrichtian, roughly 75 to 70 million years ago, toward the very end of the Cretaceous.\n\nFossil locations  \n- First described from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, USA.  \n- Additional specimens have been recovered from the Lance Formation (Wyoming) and the Scollard Formation (Alberta, Canada).  \n- All known material comes from the western interior of the ancient Western Interior Seaway’s coastal plain.\n\nPhysical description  \n- Acheroraptor possessed a sleek, lightweight skull with a slightly elongated snout and large, forward‑facing eyes, suggesting good depth perception.  \n- The dentition consisted of recurved, serrated teeth about 2 cm long, ideal for slicing flesh.  \n- Its forelimbs were relatively long, ending in a robust, sickle‑shaped second claw on each foot, the hallmark of dromaeosaurids.  \n- The tail was stiffened by elongated chevrons and ossified tendons, providing balance during rapid turns.  \n- Body covering was likely a mix of primitive feathers on the arms, tail, and possibly the neck, giving it a feathered appearance similar to modern birds of prey.  \n- Overall build was built for speed and agility rather than brute strength.\n\nFossil records  \n- The holotype (specimen USNM 538123) consists of a partial skull, several cervical vertebrae, a forearm, and portions of the pelvis and hindlimb.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated teeth, a nearly complete right hindlimb, and a partial tail vertebral column.  \n- The fossils are relatively well preserved, showing fine details of the bone surface and, in some cases, impressions of feather quill knobs on the ulna.  \n- Radiometric dating of the surrounding volcanic ash layers places the specimens firmly within the late Campanian–early Maastrichtian interval.\n\nDiet description  \n- As a carnivorous theropod, Acheroraptor was an active predator of small vertebrates.  \n- Likely prey included juvenile hadrosaurs, small ceratopsians, early mammals, lizards, and other small dinosaurs such as pachycephalosaurs.  \n- Its sharp, recurved teeth and powerful grip from the enlarged second toe claw would have allowed it to deliver precise, killing bites to soft tissue.  \n- Isotopic analysis of tooth enamel suggests a diet high in protein and consistent with a top‑order mesopredator in its ecosystem.\n\nEnvironmental description  \n- Acheroraptor inhabited the flood‑plain and coastal‑plain environments that bordered the Western Interior Seaway.  \n- The Hell Creek and Lance formations represent a mosaic of river channels, oxbow lakes, swamps, and open woodlands dominated by conifers, flowering plants, and ferns.  \n- Climate was warm and seasonally wet, with abundant water sources supporting diverse flora and fauna.  \n- Large herbivores such as Triceratops, Edmontosaurus, and Ankylosaurus roamed the same landscapes, providing both potential prey and competition.  \n- Periodic volcanic ash falls and riverine sedimentation created the fine‑grained deposits that have preserved Acheroraptor’s bones for millions of years.",

    "output": "Achillesaurus – Overview  \nAchillesaurus is a medium‑sized theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous, roughly between 85 and 78 million years ago. The genus name, meaning “Achilles’ lizard,” refers to the unusually robust and reinforced lower leg bones that suggest a powerful, spring‑loaded stride.\n\nSize  \n• Total length: about 6.5 m (21 ft) from snout to tail.  \n• Hip height: approximately 2.0 m (6.5 ft).  \n• Body mass: estimated 800–950 kg (1,760–2,100 lb).  \n\nGeological Period  \nLate Cretaceous, Campanian to early Maastrichtian stages (≈85–78 Ma).\n\nFossil Localities  \nThe only known specimens have been recovered from the Upper Cretaceous “Mendoza Formation” in western Argentina, near the Río Negro basin. Three sites have yielded material:  \n1. Site A (near Villa La Angostura) – partial skull, vertebral column, and left hind‑limb.  \n2. Site B (Valle de los Dinosaurios) – isolated teeth and a series of caudal vertebrae.  \n3. Site C (Cerro Bayo) – a nearly complete pelvis and associated ribs.\n\nPhysical Description  \nAchillesaurus possessed a streamlined, bipedal body typical of advanced coelurosaurs. The skull was relatively low and elongated, with a narrow snout lined with ziphodont (serrated) teeth. The orbit was large, indicating keen vision. The cervical vertebrae were elongated, giving the neck a moderate degree of flexibility. Its forelimbs were modest in length (about 45 % of hind‑limb length) but ended in three functional digits, each bearing a recurved claw.  \n\nThe most distinctive feature is the hypertrophied tibia and the fused distal tarsals, forming a reinforced “Achilles complex” that likely allowed rapid acceleration and powerful kicking. The tail was stiffened by elongated chevrons, providing balance during high‑speed pursuits. Skin impressions from Site B suggest a covering of small, non‑overlapping scales interspersed with larger, keeled scutes along the dorsal midline.\n\nFossil Record and Preservation  \nThe holotype (specimen MDP‑001) consists of a partial skull, cervical series, and left hind‑limb, preserved in fine‑grained mudstone that has retained delicate bone microstructure. Histological thin sections reveal rapid periosteal growth, consistent with a high metabolic rate. Isotopic analysis of the tooth enamel indicates a diet primarily of terrestrial vertebrates. The presence of articulated elements at Site A suggests rapid burial, possibly due to a flood‑plain event, while the isolated teeth at Site B are thought to be the result of fluvial transport.\n\nDiet  \nAchillesaurus was a carnivore, likely an active predator of medium‑sized herbivorous dinosaurs such as iguanodontians and small ceratopsians, as well as large lizards and crocodyliforms. The serrated teeth and strong jaw musculature point to a slicing bite, while the reinforced hind‑limbs imply it could chase down prey or deliver powerful kicks to subdue struggling animals. Occasional scavenging cannot be ruled out, as trace evidence of bone fragments in the gut region of a related specimen suggests opportunistic feeding.\n\nEnvironmental Context  \nDuring the Late Cretaceous, the Mendoza Formation represented a low‑lying floodplain bordered by meandering rivers and occasional oxbow lakes. The climate was warm and semi‑arid, with seasonal rainfall that supported a mosaic of vegetation: coniferous forests on higher ground, fern‑rich understories, and open scrublands dominated by cycads and early angiosperms. The area teemed with diverse fauna, including hadrosaurids, ankylosaurs, small sauropods, pterosaurs, and a rich assemblage of fish and amphibians in the water bodies. Periodic volcanic ash falls from the nearby Andean volcanic arc contributed to the fine sedimentation that preserved the Achillesaurus fossils.\n\nIn summary, Achillesaurus was a swift, mid‑sized theropod adapted for high‑speed pursuit and powerful hind‑limb strikes, inhabiting the dynamic floodplain ecosystems of Late Cretaceous Patagonia. Its unique tibial morphology and well‑preserved remains make it a key taxon for understanding predator dynamics in South American Cretaceous ecosystems.",

    "output": "ALBERTOSAURUS – QUICK FACT SHEET  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 8 to 9 metres (26–30 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 3 metres (10 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 1.5–2 tonnes.  \n\nGeological Time Range  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage, about 76 to 74 million years ago.  \n\nFossil Localities  \n- Primary discoveries in the Belly River Group of southern Alberta, Canada (e.g., the Dinosaur Provincial Park and the Milk River Formation).  \n- Additional specimens have been found in the Oldman and Judith River formations of Montana, USA, confirming a range that extended across the western interior of North America.  \n\nPhysical Description  \n- Member of the tyrannosaurid family, closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex but more slender.  \n- Skull length about 1 metre, with a deep, robust jaw housing large, serrated teeth (up to 12 cm long).  \n- Forelimbs short but muscular, each bearing two clawed digits; hind limbs long and powerful, built for rapid pursuit.  \n- Body covered with a mix of small, scale‑like skin impressions and possible feather‑like filaments on the neck and forearms, as suggested by related tyrannosaurids.  \n- Tail stiffened by elongated vertebral processes, acting as a counter‑balance for the massive head.  \n\nFossil Record Highlights  \n- The holotype specimen (CMN 8776) consists of a nearly complete skull and partial post‑cranial skeleton, discovered in 1902 near the Red Deer River.  \n- Over 30 additional specimens have been catalogued, ranging from isolated teeth to nearly complete skeletons, providing a robust sample size for growth‑series studies.  \n- Bone histology shows rapid growth rates during juvenile stages, with a slowdown after reaching near‑adult size, typical of large theropods.  \n\nDiet and Feeding Behavior  \n- Carnivorous apex predator, preying on contemporaneous herbivores such as hadrosaurs (e.g., Maiasaura), ceratopsians (e.g., Centrosaurus), and smaller ornithopods.  \n- Bite force estimates around 6,000 N, sufficient to crush bone and tear flesh.  \n- Likely employed a combination of ambush and active pursuit, using its relatively long legs to close distances quickly.  \n- Evidence of tooth wear patterns and gut contents in some specimens indicates a diet that included both large vertebrate prey and occasional scavenging of carcasses.  \n\nEnvironmental Context  \n- Inhabited a warm, semi‑arid floodplain ecosystem dominated by river channels, oxbow lakes, and seasonal wetlands.  \n- Vegetation comprised coniferous forests, ginkgoes, ferns, and flowering plants, providing abundant food for herbivorous dinosaurs.  \n- Climate was temperate to subtropical with distinct wet and dry seasons, leading to periodic flooding that contributed to the rapid burial of remains in river‑borne sediments—explaining the excellent preservation of Albertosaurus fossils in the Belly River Group.  \n\nOverall, Albertosaurus was a fast, agile tyrannosaurid that ruled the Late Cretaceous plains of western North America, preying on the abundant herbivores of its richly vegetated floodplain world.",

    "output": "Alectrosaurus (meaning “defensive lizard”) is a medium‑sized theropod dinosaur known from the Late Cretaceous of Central Asia.  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 5 to 6 metres (16–20 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 1.5 m (5 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 400–600 kg (900–1 300 lb).  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 80 to 72 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All confirmed material comes from the Bayan Shireh Formation in western Mongolia, near the town of Bayankhongor.  \n- Isolated teeth and a few fragmentary post‑cranial bones have also been reported from the Nemegt and Bissekty formations, but these are less certain.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Alectrosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a slender, lightly built body.  \n- The skull was relatively long and low, equipped with a set of recurved, serrated teeth suited for slicing flesh.  \n- Forelimbs were short but robust, ending in three-fingered hands with sharp claws.  \n- The hind limbs were long and powerful, indicating good running ability; the tibia was longer than the femur, a trait seen in fast‑moving theropods.  \n- The tail was stiffened by elongated chevrons, providing balance during rapid pursuit.  \n- Skin impressions are unknown, but based on related tyrannosauroids it likely bore a covering of small, scale‑like dermal ossicles.  \n\nFossil record  \n- The holotype (IGM 100/201) consists of a partial right femur and several isolated teeth, discovered in 1970 by a Soviet‑Mongolian expedition.  \n- Additional specimens include a partial pelvis (IGM 100/202) and a series of caudal vertebrae (IGM 100/203).  \n- The material is fragmentary, so most reconstructions rely on comparisons with better‑known tyrannosauroids such as Alioramus and Tarbosaurus.  \n- No complete skeleton has yet been found, making precise estimates of body proportions tentative.  \n\nDiet  \n- As a carnivore, Alectrosaurus likely preyed on medium‑sized herbivorous dinosaurs such as hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, and small ankylosaurs.  \n- Its serrated teeth and strong jaw muscles suggest it could deliver deep, flesh‑cutting bites.  \n- The relatively light build and long legs imply a hunting strategy based on speed and pursuit rather than ambush.  \n- Scavenging may have supplemented its diet, especially in the arid seasonal intervals when live prey were scarce.  \n\nEnvironmental context  \n- The Bayan Shireh Formation represents a semi‑arid floodplain with seasonal rivers and occasional lake deposits.  \n- Vegetation consisted of conifers, ginkgos, and flowering plants forming open woodlands and riparian thickets.  \n- Climate was warm with distinct wet and dry seasons, producing periodic flooding that left fine sandstones and mudstones where the fossils are preserved.  \n- The ecosystem supported a diverse dinosaur fauna, including large herbivores (hadrosaurids, sauropods), other theropods (tetanurans, dromaeosaurids), and numerous crocodyliforms and turtles.  \n- In this setting, Alectrosaurus would have been an agile predator, exploiting the open spaces near water sources to chase down prey, while also taking advantage of the abundant carcasses left by larger apex predators.",

    "output": "Alioramus – Overview  \n--------------------  \n\n**Size**  \n- Length: approximately 5–6 meters (16–20 feet) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: about 1.5 meters (5 feet).  \n- Weight: estimated 500–800 kilograms (1,100–1,800 lb).  \n\n**Geological Time Range**  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage, roughly 71 to 70 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- Primary specimens have been recovered from the Nemegt Formation in southern Mongolia.  \n- Additional fragmentary material has been found in the Bayan Shireh and the Gobi Desert regions, confirming a broader distribution across the eastern Asian landmass.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n- Belonged to the tyrannosaurid family but was considerably more slender than its famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex.  \n- Skull: elongated and low, measuring about 60 cm (2 ft) in length, with a series of pronounced, narrow, vertical ridges running along the dorsal surface of the snout.  \n- Teeth: moderately sized, laterally compressed, with serrated edges suitable for slicing flesh; the dentition is less robust than that of larger tyrannosaurids.  \n- Limbs: forelimbs were relatively long for a tyrannosaur, possessing three functional digits with sharp claws; hind limbs were powerful, ending in three-toed feet with large, curved claws.  \n- Body covering: skin impressions are lacking, but based on related tyrannosaurids, it likely possessed a scaly integument, possibly with small feather-like filaments in juvenile stages.  \n- Tail: long and stiffened by ossified tendons, providing balance during rapid locomotion.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- The holotype (IGM 100/1125) consists of a partial skull, several vertebrae, and limb fragments, discovered in 1970 and described in 1976.  \n- Subsequent finds include a more complete skull (IGM 100/1126) and additional postcranial elements, allowing reconstruction of the skull shape and body proportions.  \n- The fossil material is relatively fragmentary, but the presence of multiple individuals suggests that Alioramus may have lived in small groups or that the area was a common hunting ground.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- As a carnivore, Alioramus likely preyed on medium-sized herbivorous dinosaurs such as hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, and smaller ankylosaurs.  \n- Its slender build and elongated snout imply a hunting strategy focused on speed and agility, possibly ambushing prey or pursuing it over short distances.  \n- Tooth wear patterns indicate a diet consisting mainly of flesh, with occasional ingestion of bone fragments, suggesting it could process both soft tissue and tougher material.  \n\n**Environmental Context**  \n- The Nemegt Formation represents a fluvial plain with meandering rivers, floodplains, and occasional lake deposits, indicating a relatively humid climate with seasonal rainfall.  \n- Vegetation would have included conifers, cycads, ferns, and early flowering plants, providing abundant food for herbivorous dinosaurs.  \n- The ecosystem supported a diverse dinosaur fauna: large herbivores such as Saurolophus, Tarbosaurus, and Therizinosaurus, as well as smaller theropods, pterosaurs, and early mammals.  \n- The presence of abundant water sources and lush vegetation created a productive environment where a mid‑sized predator like Alioramus could thrive, exploiting niches that larger tyrannosaurids might have left open.  \n\nIn summary, Alioramus was a relatively small, fast‑moving tyrannosaurid of the Late Cretaceous Asian plains, distinguished by its elongated, ridged snout and slender body. Its fossil record, though incomplete, provides enough evidence to reconstruct its anatomy, predatory habits, and the lush riverine habitats it inhabited.",

    "output": "Allosaurus – Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Length: 8.5–12 m (28–39 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: about 2.5 m (8 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 1.5–2.5 t (3,300–5,500 lb).  \n- Skull length up to 0.9 m (3 ft) with powerful jaws and large, serrated teeth.  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic, roughly 155–145 million years ago.  \n- Most abundant in the Oxfordian to Tithonian stages, with a peak in the Kimmeridgian.  \n\nFossil locations (major sites)  \n- North America: Morrison Formation (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, South Dakota).  \n- Europe: Tendaguru Beds (Tanzania, historically part of the German East Africa colony) and the Upper Jurassic deposits of Portugal and the United Kingdom (e.g., the Oxford Clay).  \n- Africa: Tendaguru (Tanzania) yields the most complete specimens, including the famous “Allosaurus” skeletons (e.g., “Allosaurus” “Morrison” and “Allosaurus” “Tendaguru”).  \n- Minor finds: isolated teeth and vertebrae reported from the Jurassic of China and Argentina, but these are fragmentary and sometimes assigned to related megalosaurids.  \n\nPhysical description  \nAllosaurus was a large, bipedal theropod with a robust, muscular build. Its skull was relatively low and broad compared to later tyrannosaurids, with a pair of large, forward‑projecting maxillary teeth and a series of smaller, blade‑like teeth along the lower jaw. The teeth were laterally compressed and serrated, ideal for slicing flesh. The forelimbs were relatively long for a theropod, ending in three-fingered hands with strong, curved claws; the middle digit was the longest. The neck was flexible, allowing rapid side‑to‑side motion, while the tail was stiffened by elongated chevrons, providing balance during fast runs. Skin impressions suggest a covering of small, non‑overlapping scales, possibly with larger scutes along the dorsal midline. Some specimens show evidence of a crest or ridge of bone above the eyes, perhaps used for display or species recognition.  \n\nFossil record and notable specimens  \n- The first Allosaurus material was described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877 (Allosaurus fragilis) from the Morrison Formation of Colorado.  \n- The “Morrison” specimen (CM 113) is a nearly complete skeleton with a well‑preserved skull, providing the basis for most reconstructions.  \n- The “Tendaguru” specimens (e.g., MB.R. 2160) are among the largest individuals known, reaching the upper size estimates.  \n- The “Allosaurus” “Satan” (UCSC 100) is a juvenile with delicate bone texture, offering insight into growth patterns.  \n- Over 30 relatively complete skeletons and dozens of isolated bones and teeth have been catalogued, making Allosaurus one of the best‑known large Jurassic theropods. Histological studies of bone thin sections reveal rapid growth rates, with individuals reaching adult size in roughly 10–12 years.  \n\nDiet and feeding behavior  \nAllosaurus was an apex predator and opportunistic carnivore. Its serrated teeth and strong jaw muscles allowed it to deliver deep, slashing bites, likely targeting the soft tissue of large herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs, sauropods, and ornithopods. Bite‑force estimates suggest a moderate bite compared with later tyrannosaurids, so it may have relied on a “hatchet‑like” killing technique—using its forelimbs to grasp prey while delivering repeated, powerful slashes with its jaws. Evidence of healed bite marks on sauropod bones and coprolites containing bone fragments confirm it fed on large prey. Occasionally, Allosaurus may have scavenged carcasses, and smaller individuals could have hunted smaller vertebrates, including early mammals and lizards.  \n\nEnvironmental context  \nAllosaurus inhabited the semi‑arid floodplains and river valleys of the Late Jurassic Morrison ecosystem. The climate was warm with pronounced seasonal rainfall, supporting a mosaic of coniferous forests, fern‑laden understories, and open scrubland. Seasonal rivers created lush riparian zones that attracted herbivores such as Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and massive sauropods (e.g., Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus). These herbivores formed the primary prey base for Allosaurus. The landscape also featured volcanic ash layers, indicating periodic volcanic activity that contributed to the preservation of many fossils. In the African Tendaguru region, the environment was similarly a coastal plain with tidal influences, supporting a diverse assemblage of marine and terrestrial fauna, including crocodilians, turtles, and early pterosaurs, which would have been additional food sources or competitors.  \n\nIn summary, Allosaurus was a large, agile, and versatile Jurassic predator, well‑adapted to a dynamic ecosystem of floodplains, forests, and river corridors, and its abundant, well‑preserved fossil record provides a detailed window into the life of top theropods before the rise of the Cretaceous giants.",

    "output": "Alvarezsaurus calvoi – a small, bipedal theropod from the Late Cretaceous of South America  \n\nSize  \n• Length: roughly 2 m (6.5 ft) from snout to tip of the tail.  \n• Height at the hips: about 1 m (3.3 ft).  \n• Estimated mass: 15–20 kg (33–44 lb).  \n\nPeriod range  \nAlvarezsaurus lived during the early Late Cretaceous, specifically the Cenomanian–Turonian interval, about 86 to 84 million years ago.  \n\nFossil location  \nAll known material comes from the Candeleros Formation of the Neuquén Province in north‑western Patagonia, Argentina. The type specimen was recovered near the town of Alvarezs, which gave the genus its name.  \n\nPhysical description  \nThe animal had a slender, lightly built body with long, powerful hind‑limbs built for fast running. Its pelvis was narrow, and the tail was stiffened by elongated chevrons, providing balance. The fore‑limbs were highly reduced, ending in a single, massive claw on each hand – a hallmark of alvarezsaurids. The skull was small, with a short snout, large orbits, and reduced dentition (only a few tiny teeth). The overall impression is that of a tiny, agile runner with a specialized digging hand.  \n\nFossil records  \nThe holotype (PVL 2475) consists of a partial skeleton: several dorsal and caudal vertebrae, a well‑preserved pelvis, both femora, tibiae, fibulae, a partial left foot, and the distinctive fore‑limb with the enlarged claw. Additional referred material includes isolated vertebrae and limb fragments from the same formation, confirming the presence of a small alvarezsaurid fauna in Patagonia. No complete skull has yet been found, so many details of the cranial anatomy remain inferred from close relatives such as Mononykus and Shuvuuia.  \n\nDiet description  \nAlvarezsaurus is interpreted as an insectivore, most likely a specialist in feeding on social insects such as termites or ants. The reduced dentition, strong fore‑claw, and robust fore‑arm suggest a digging lifestyle, using the claw to break into insect nests. Its slender jaws would have been suited for snapping up soft-bodied prey rather than processing large vertebrate meat.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \nDuring the Cenomanian–Turonian the Candeleros Formation represented a semi‑arid floodplain crossed by braided river channels. The climate was warm with seasonal rainfall, supporting a mosaic of vegetation: low‑lying conifers, ginkgophytes, ferns, and occasional flowering plants. Open sandy patches and occasional mud‑flat areas would have been ideal for burrowing insects, providing a plentiful food source for a small digger like Alvarezsaurus. The ecosystem also hosted larger herbivorous sauropods, ornithopods, and a variety of crocodyliforms, creating a dynamic community in which Alvarezsaurus occupied the niche of a fast‑moving, insect‑specialist forager.",

    "output": "Amargasaurus (Amargasaurus cazaui) – Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 10–12 metres (33–39 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 3.5 m (11.5 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 5–7 tonnes.  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Early Cretaceous, specifically the Barremian stage, approximately 129 to 125 million years ago.  \n\nFossil discovery sites  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the La Amarga Formation in the Neuquén Province of north‑western Argentina, South America.  \n- The type locality is near the town of Villa El Chocón, close to the Amarga River, which gave the genus its name.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Amargasaurus was a member of the dicraeosaurid family of sauropods, characterized by a relatively short neck and a low, broad body compared with the gigantic, long‑necked titanosaurs.  \n- The most striking feature was a pair of parallel rows of tall, thin neural spines that ran along the neck and anterior part of the back, reaching up to 1.5 m (5 ft) in height. These spines may have supported a sail‑like membrane, a keratinous sheath, or a display structure.  \n- The skull was small and low, with a short, deep snout and a beak‑like premaxilla. Teeth were leaf‑shaped, arranged in a relatively narrow dental battery suited for cropping vegetation.  \n- The forelimbs were robust but shorter than the hind limbs, giving the animal a slightly crouched stance.  \n- Tail vertebrae were relatively short and bore low neural spines, ending in a small club‑like tip.  \n\nFossil record and specimens  \n- The holotype (PVL 3997) consists of a partial skeleton: several cervical and dorsal vertebrae with the characteristic elongated spines, a fragmentary pelvis, ribs, and portions of the fore‑ and hind‑limbs.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated vertebrae, limb bones, and a few cranial fragments found in the same formation, which together provide a fairly complete picture of the skeleton.  \n- No complete skull has been recovered, so reconstructions of the head are based on related dicraeosaurids such as Dicraeosaurus and Brachytrachelus.  \n- The preservation is generally good, with the neural spines showing fine surface texture that suggests they were not merely bony ridges but likely supported soft tissue.  \n\nDiet  \n- As a herbivore, Amargasaurus fed on low‑ to mid‑height vegetation. The leaf‑shaped teeth indicate a browsing diet, stripping foliage from conifers, cycads, ferns, and early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to diversify in the Barremian.  \n- The relatively short neck suggests it fed closer to the ground than the high‑browsing sauropods, possibly cropping vegetation up to about 2 m (6.5 ft) high.  \n- The presence of a beak‑like premaxilla and a dental battery adapted for rapid tooth replacement would have allowed it to process large amounts of fibrous plant material efficiently.  \n\nEnvironmental context  \n- The La Amarga Formation represents a fluvial‑lacustrine system that existed on the western margin of the ancient South American continent (Gondwana).  \n- The landscape was a mosaic of river channels, floodplains, and shallow lakes surrounded by forested areas. Climate was warm and semi‑arid with seasonal rainfall, supporting a diverse flora of conifers, podocarps, ginkgophytes, ferns, and the early rise of angiosperms.  \n- The ecosystem also hosted a variety of other dinosaurs, including the large titanosaur Argentinosaurus, the theropod Abelisaurids, and smaller ornithopods, as well as crocodile‑like archosaurs, turtles, and early mammals.  \n- Periodic volcanic ash falls contributed to the rapid burial of remains, aiding the preservation of the Amargasaurus skeletons.  \n\nIn summary, Amargasaurus was a medium‑sized, early Cretaceous dicraeosaurid sauropod distinguished by its towering neck and dorsal spines, adapted for a browsing herbivorous lifestyle within a river‑dominated, forested environment of what is now north‑western Argentina.",

    "output": "Ammosaurus – “sand lizard” – is a basal sauropod dinosaur known from the Early Jurassic of western North America.  \n\nSize  \nAdult individuals are estimated to have reached lengths of roughly 12–14 metres (40–45 ft), a shoulder height of about 5 metres (16 ft) and a body mass in the range of 7–9 tonnes. The neck was moderately elongated, comprising about 12 vertebrae, while the tail was long and muscular, ending in a tapered tip.  \n\nPeriod range  \nAmmosaurus lived during the Sinemurian to early Pliensbachian stages of the Early Jurassic, approximately 190 – 180 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \nThe only material attributed to the genus has been recovered from the Kayenta Formation of northeastern Arizona and from the lower Navajo Sandstone of southern Utah, United States. These strata represent ancient desert and interdune environments that were periodically intersected by river channels.  \n\nPhysical description  \nThe skull of Ammosaurus was small and low‑set, with a blunt snout and simple, leaf‑shaped teeth suited for cropping vegetation. The neck vertebrae were relatively robust, bearing deep lateral depressions that suggest strong neck musculature. The dorsal vertebrae are opisthocoelous (convex in front, concave behind), a primitive sauropod trait, and the neural arches are reinforced by thick laminae. The forelimbs were columnar and bore a large, barrel‑shaped humerus; the hind limbs were similarly stout, with a massive femur that supported the animal’s weight. The tail vertebrae taper gradually, ending in a flexible, whip‑like tip. Skin impressions from related early sauropods indicate a covering of small, polygonal scales; no definitive osteoderms have been found for Ammosaurus, but isolated bony plates in the fossil matrix hint at the possible presence of scattered dermal armor.  \n\nFossil record  \nThe genus is known from a limited but diagnostic assemblage: a series of cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a partial sacrum, fragments of the pelvis, a left humerus, a right femur, and a few isolated teeth. These specimens were first collected in 1915 by Earl Douglass during the early Carnegie expeditions and were formally described by Charles W. Gilmore in 1925. Because the material is fragmentary, Ammosaurus is sometimes regarded as a nomen dubium, but recent re‑examinations of the vertebrae suggest it represents a distinct early sauropod lineage distinct from contemporaneous genera such as Barapasaurus and early Camarasaurids.  \n\nDiet description  \nAmmosaurus was a strict herbivore. Its leaf‑shaped, spatulate teeth were suited for stripping foliage rather than grinding, indicating it likely fed on soft‑to‑moderately tough plant material. In the Early Jurassic of the western United States, the dominant flora included low‑lying ferns, horsetails, seed ferns (pteridosperms), and the early conifers of the Voltziales. The relatively short neck compared with later sauropods suggests Ammosaurus fed primarily at or just above ground level, browsing the understory and the lower crowns of coniferous shrubs that grew along riverbanks and in oasis‑like patches within the desert matrix.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \nDuring the Sinemurian‑Pliensbachian the Kayenta and Navajo regions were dominated by an arid to semi‑arid climate with extensive sand dunes (ergs) interspersed with occasional fluvial channels and seasonal floodplains. The landscape featured riparian woodlands along the river margins, where moisture supported a richer vegetation assemblage, while the surrounding dunes were sparsely vegetated, dominated by hardy xerophytic plants such as early cycads and low‑lying ferns that could survive in sandy soils. Seasonal monsoonal rains likely produced brief but intense flooding events, depositing the mudstones and sandstones that now preserve the fossils. Ammosaurus would have moved across this patchwork of open sand and vegetated corridors, using its massive limbs to traverse soft substrates and its long tail for balance while feeding.  \n\nIn summary, Ammosaurus was a medium‑sized, early sauropod adapted to a harsh, desert‑like Early Jurassic world, feeding on the limited but diverse plant life that grew in riverine oases and dune‑edge habitats, and leaving behind a modest but informative fossil record that helps paleontologists trace the early evolution of the giant sauropod lineage.",

    "output": "Ampelosaurus – Overview  \nAmpelosaurus is a titanosaurian sauropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now southwestern Europe. It is known from relatively complete skeletal material, making it one of the best‑understood European titanosaurs.\n\nSize  \n- Length: approximately 15–18 metres (50–60 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the shoulder: about 4 m (13 ft).  \n- Estimated mass: 12–15 tonnes, comparable to a modern elephant bus.\n\nGeological time range  \n- Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian to Maastrichtian stages (about 84 to 66 million years ago). Most specimens are dated to the upper Campanian–early Maastrichtian, roughly 70–66 Ma.\n\nFossil locations  \n- The type locality is the “Marnes Rouges” (Red Marls) of the Haute‑Garonne department in southwestern France, near the village of Saint‑Romain‑de‑Lerps.  \n- Additional material has been recovered from the “Marnes de la Vallée du Loup” (also in France) and from the “Marnes de la Vallée du Garonne” in Spain, indicating a broader distribution across the Pyrenean‑Mediterranean region.\n\nPhysical description  \n- Body plan typical of titanosaurs: a massive, barrel‑shaped torso supported by columnar limbs.  \n- Neck: relatively short for a sauropod, with about 12 cervical vertebrae, suggesting a low‑to‑mid‑level browsing habit.  \n- Tail: robust and muscular, ending in a possible “club‑like” distal expansion seen in some related taxa.  \n- Skull: poorly known because cranial elements are rare, but the few fragments indicate a small, narrow skull with leaf‑shaped teeth.  \n- Armor: several osteoderms (bony plates) have been found associated with the skeleton, implying that Ampelosaurus possessed a modest “body armor” covering the dorsal surface, a feature common in many titanosaurs.  \n- Skin impressions are lacking, but the presence of osteoderms suggests a protective integument.\n\nFossil record and preservation  \n- The original discovery (1995) yielded a partial skeleton including vertebrae, ribs, limb bones, pelvic girdle and several osteoderms.  \n- Subsequent excavations have produced multiple individuals, ranging from juveniles to fully grown adults, allowing growth‑series studies.  \n- The fossils are preserved in fluvial‑lacustrine red‑marls, indicating rapid burial in flood‑plain sediments, which helped retain articulated elements.  \n- Histological analysis of bone tissue shows relatively fast growth rates for a titanosaur, with lines of arrested growth indicating seasonal pauses.\n\nDiet  \n- Herbivorous, feeding on low‑ to mid‑height vegetation.  \n- Tooth morphology (spatulate, leaf‑shaped teeth) points to a diet of soft coniferous foliage, cycads, and possibly early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to diversify in the Late Cretaceous.  \n- The relatively short neck suggests Ampelosaurus grazed close to the ground or browsed from low shrubs rather than reaching the high canopy.\n\nEnvironment  \n- The red‑marls of the Campanian‑Maastrichtian of southwestern France represent a warm, semi‑arid flood‑plain with seasonal rainfall.  \n- The landscape was dominated by river channels, oxbow lakes, and expansive flood‑plain soils that supported a mix of conifer forests, fern thickets, and scattered angiosperm shrubs.  \n- Climate was temperate to subtropical, with warm summers and milder winters, allowing a diverse assemblage of dinosaurs, crocodilians, turtles, and early mammals to coexist.  \n- Periodic volcanic ash falls, recorded in the sedimentary layers, contributed to the rapid burial of carcasses, aiding fossil preservation.  \n\nIn summary, Ampelosaurus was a medium‑sized European titanosaur that roamed the lush flood‑plains of Late Cretaceous southwestern Europe, feeding on abundant low vegetation, protected by a modest armor of osteoderms, and leaving a relatively rich fossil record that illuminates its biology and the ecosystems it inhabited.",

    "output": "Amygdalodon is a relatively early sauropod that lived during the Middle Jurassic, roughly between 174 and 164 million years ago. The only known material comes from the Cañadón Asfalto Formation of Patagonia, Argentina, where a partial skeleton was recovered near the town of Las Chacritas in the Chubut Province. The fossils consist of a series of vertebrae (cervical, dorsal and caudal), several ribs, fragments of the pelvis and a few limb bones, which together give a fairly clear picture of the animal’s size and anatomy.\n\nSize and build  \nBased on the preserved vertebrae and limb fragments, Amygdalodon is estimated to have reached a total length of about 12–14 metres (40–46 feet) and a shoulder height of roughly 4 metres (13 feet). Its body mass is thought to have been in the range of 8–10 tonnes. The animal possessed a long, robust neck composed of relatively short cervical vertebrae, a massive barrel‑shaped torso, and a long, tapering tail. The limbs were columnar and sturdy, supporting the great weight of the animal, while the forelimbs were slightly shorter than the hind limbs, a condition typical of early sauropods.\n\nPhysical description  \nThe name “Amygdalodon” (meaning “almond tooth”) refers to the distinctive almond‑shaped dentition seen in the few teeth that have been recovered. The teeth are spatulate, with a broad crown and coarse serrations along the edges, indicating a herbivorous diet. The vertebrae display a combination of primitive and derived features: the neural arches are thick and the centra are relatively solid, yet the dorsal vertebrae already show the beginnings of the pleurocoel air‑filled cavities that later sauropods would develop for weight reduction. The pelvis is broad, with a well‑developed ilium and a sturdy pubis that points forward, suggesting a powerful musculature for supporting the massive gut.\n\nFossil record  \nAmygdalodon is known from a single, partially articulated specimen (specimen number PVL 2475) discovered in 1995. The find includes:  \n\n* 12 cervical vertebrae, some of which retain neural spines and transverse processes.  \n* 8 dorsal vertebrae with early pleurocoel development.  \n* 5 caudal vertebrae.  \n* Two partial ribs and fragments of the gastralia.  \n* Portions of the sacrum and a fragmentary left femur.  \n* Several isolated teeth and a few pedal phalanges.  \n\nThese remains are housed at the Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio in Trelew, Argentina, and have been the subject of several descriptive papers since the early 2000s. No additional specimens have been assigned to Amygdalodon, making it a monotypic genus known only from this locality.\n\nDiet  \nThe dentition and jaw mechanics indicate a herbivorous diet. The broad, leaf‑shaped teeth were well suited for stripping foliage rather than grinding, suggesting that Amygdalodon relied on a large, fermenting gut to break down plant material. The animal likely fed on low‑to‑mid‑height vegetation such as ferns, cycads, bennettitaleans and early conifers that dominated the Jurassic flora of Patagonia. The lack of extensive dental wear implies that the plant matter was relatively soft, and the animal may have supplemented its diet with occasional shoots or seed cones.\n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Middle Jurassic, the Cañadón Asfalto basin was a lush, semi‑arid floodplain interspersed with river channels, lakes and volcanic ash deposits. The climate was warm and seasonally wet, supporting a diverse assemblage of plants: towering coniferous trees, understory ferns, horsetails, and abundant gymnosperm shrubs. The presence of volcanic tuffs indicates periodic eruptions that contributed to the preservation of the fossil beds. In this ecosystem Amygdalodon would have been one of the largest terrestrial herbivores, sharing its habitat with early theropods (such as a basal megalosaurid), small ornithischians, and a variety of crocodylomorphs and early mammals. The abundant water sources and plentiful vegetation would have provided the resources needed to sustain a massive, high‑browsing sauropod, while the relatively open landscape allowed it to move across large distances in search of fresh forage.",

    "output": "**Anchiceratops – Overview**\n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 5.5–6 meters (18–20 feet) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2 meters (6.5 feet).  \n- Weight: estimated 2–3 metric tons.\n\n**Geological Time Range**  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage.  \n- Approximate age: 75 to 71 million years ago.\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Upper Cretaceous formations of western Canada, chiefly the Dinosaur Park Formation and the Oldman Formation in Alberta.  \n- A few fragmentary remains have also been reported from the Two Medicine Formation in Montana, USA, but these are less certain.\n\n**Physical Description**  \n- Belonged to the ceratopsid family, subfamily Centrosaurinae.  \n- Possessed a large, solid frill extending backward from the skull, ornamented with a series of modestly sized epoccipitals (small bony spikes) along its margin.  \n- The nasal horn was relatively short and stout, while the brow horns were small, low, and positioned close together above the eyes.  \n- The skull measured roughly 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length, giving the animal a distinctive “horned” profile.  \n- Body was robust and quadrupedal, with strong, columnar limbs supporting a barrel‑shaped torso.  \n- The tail was relatively short compared to some other ceratopsians, ending in a small, bony club.  \n- Skin impressions are lacking, but, as with other ceratopsids, it likely bore a covering of scaly skin with possible keratinous sheaths over the horns and frill.\n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- The type specimen (CMN 8800) consists of a nearly complete skull and partial postcranial skeleton, discovered near the Red Deer River in 1912.  \n- Additional specimens include several partial skulls, isolated frill pieces, and a few nearly complete skeletons that have been catalogued in the Canadian Museum of Nature and the Royal Tyrrell Museum.  \n- The abundance of cranial material makes Anchiceratops one of the better‑known centrosaurines, allowing detailed studies of its cranial ornamentation and growth series.  \n- No complete articulated skeleton has yet been found; most reconstructions are based on composite assemblages of multiple individuals.\n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous, feeding primarily on low‑lying to mid‑height vegetation.  \n- Dental batteries comprised hundreds of tightly packed teeth arranged in rows, ideal for grinding tough plant material such as ferns, cycads, and the emerging flowering plants (angiosperms) of the Late Cretaceous.  \n- Wear patterns suggest a diet that included both fibrous foliage and softer leaves, indicating a flexible feeding strategy that could exploit seasonal plant availability.\n\n**Environment**  \n- Lived in a warm, humid floodplain ecosystem dominated by river channels, swamps, and coastal plains.  \n- The Dinosaur Park and Oldman formations preserve a mosaic of habitats: coniferous forests, deciduous riverbanks, and open herbaceous plains.  \n- Climate was subtropical to temperate, with distinct wet and dry seasons, supporting a diverse flora that included conifers (e.g., *Metasequoia*), ginkgos, bennettitaleans, and a growing diversity of angiosperms.  \n- The region was teeming with other dinosaurs: hadrosaurs such as *Edmontosaurus*, tyrannosaurids like *Albertosaurus*, ankylosaurs, and smaller theropods.  \n- Periodic volcanic ash falls and riverine sedimentation created the fine-grained sandstones and mudstones that now preserve Anchiceratops fossils.  \n\n**Summary**  \nAnchiceratops was a medium‑sized centrosaurine ceratopsian that roamed the lush floodplains of what is now western Canada during the late Campanian. Its distinctive frill and modest horns set it apart from its relatives, while its robust jaws and dental batteries allowed it to process a varied plant diet. The relatively rich fossil record, concentrated in Alberta’s Dinosaur Park and Oldman formations, provides a clear picture of its anatomy, growth, and the vibrant ecosystem it inhabited.",

    "output": "Anchiornis (meaning “near bird”) is a small, feathered theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, roughly 160–155 million years ago.  \n\n**Size**  \n- Adult body length: about 0.6 m (2 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Hip height: roughly 0.2 m (8 in).  \n- Weight: estimated 0.5–1 kg (1–2 lb), comparable to a modern pigeon.  \n\n**Geological time range**  \n- Upper Jurassic, specifically the Tithonian stage, around 160–155 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil locations**  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Tiaojishan Formation in Liaoning Province, northeastern China. The formation consists of volcanic‑ash‑rich lake deposits that have yielded exceptionally preserved feathered dinosaurs.  \n\n**Physical description**  \n- Skull: small, lightly built, with a long, narrow snout and large, forward‑facing eyes suggesting good vision.  \n- Teeth: numerous, recurved, and serrated, typical of small carnivorous theropods.  \n- Limbs: forelimbs are relatively long, about 80 % of hind‑limb length, bearing well‑developed, asymmetrical flight feathers on the arms and hands. Hind limbs are slender with long, curved claws on the second toe, indicating a grasping ability.  \n- Feathers: a full “dinosaur‑bird” plumage covering the body, including pennaceous (flight‑type) feathers on the arms and tail, and downy filaments on the neck, back and legs. The coloration inferred from melanosome analysis suggests a dark, possibly iridescent body with a lighter, possibly reddish or yellowish “band” across the forearms.  \n- Tail: long and bony, ending in a feathered “pennaceous” tail fan that would have helped with balance and possibly rudimentary aerial maneuvering.  \n\n**Fossil record**  \n- The holotype (specimen IVPP V11584) consists of a nearly complete, articulated skeleton preserved in fine volcanic ash, showing exquisite feather detail.  \n- Additional referred specimens (e.g., IVPP V11585, V11586) provide variation in size and feather arrangement, confirming that the species is known from multiple individuals rather than a single outlier.  \n- The preservation includes impressions of individual feather barbs and melanosomes, allowing scientists to reconstruct both plumage pattern and probable coloration.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- Dental morphology and wear patterns indicate a carnivorous diet focused on small vertebrates such as early mammals, lizards, and possibly juvenile dinosaurs.  \n- The long, curved second toe claw could have been used to grasp prey, while the sharp, serrated teeth would have sliced flesh.  \n- Some researchers suggest opportunistic omnivory, as the small size and agile locomotion would also allow it to exploit insects and other invertebrates.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- Anchiornis inhabited a forested, lake‑margin ecosystem dominated by coniferous trees, ginkgos, and early cycads.  \n- The Tiaojishan Formation records a warm, humid climate with seasonal rainfall, supporting a rich understory of ferns and horsetails.  \n- Volcanic activity was frequent, depositing ash layers that periodically buried organisms, creating the exceptional fossil preservation seen today.  \n- The habitat would have offered abundant perching sites in the trees, open ground for quick sprints, and shallow water margins where prey could be hunted.  \n\nOverall, Anchiornis represents one of the earliest known dinosaurs with a bird‑like feather arrangement, bridging the gap between non‑avian theropods and true birds, and its well‑preserved fossils provide a detailed window into Jurassic life and the early evolution of flight‑related traits.",

    "output": "Anchisaurus – Overview  \nAnchisaurus was a small, early sauropodomorph that lived during the Early Jurassic period, roughly between 199 and 183 million years ago. It is one of the earliest known members of the lineage that would later give rise to the giant long‑necked sauropods.\n\nSize  \nAdult individuals reached an estimated length of about 2 to 2.5 metres (6.5–8 ft) and stood roughly 1 metre (3 ft) tall at the hip. Body mass is thought to have been in the range of 30–50 kg (65–110 lb), making it comparable in size to a modern large dog or a small goat.\n\nPeriod Range  \n- Early Jurassic, primarily the Hettangian to Sinemurian stages (≈199–190 Ma).  \n- Some material may extend into the early Pliensbachian (≈190–183 Ma), but the core record is Hettangian–Sinemurian.\n\nFossil Localities  \nThe most important specimens have been recovered from the Newark Supergroup of eastern North America, especially:  \n- The Portland Formation (Connecticut, USA) – the type locality where the first fossils were described.  \n- The Kayenta Formation (Arizona, USA) – yields additional postcranial material.  \n- The East Berlin Formation (New Jersey, USA) – provides isolated bones and teeth.  \nThese sites are part of the rift‑valley sediments that filled the early Atlantic basin.\n\nPhysical Description  \nAnchisaurus possessed a slender, bipedal body with a long neck and tail. Key features include:  \n- A relatively small skull (≈15 cm long) with a short, deep snout and large eye sockets.  \n- Teeth that are leaf‑shaped and slightly serrated, suited for cropping vegetation.  \n- A flexible neck composed of at least 12 cervical vertebrae, allowing modest upward and forward reach.  \n- Forelimbs that were shorter than the hind limbs but still well‑developed, bearing five digits; the hand shows an incipient reduction of the outer digits, a trend toward the sauropod condition.  \n- Hind limbs were robust, with a strong femur and a plantigrade foot bearing five toes, the inner three bearing weight‑bearing claws.  \n- The tail was long and tapering, likely used for balance while moving quickly.\n\nFossil Record  \nSince its first description by Edward Drinker Cope in 1878, more than a dozen partial skeletons and numerous isolated bones have been catalogued. The most complete specimen (CM 11337) includes a nearly complete skull, vertebral column, ribs, pelvis, and both fore‑ and hind‑limbs, providing a solid basis for reconstruction. Additional finds consist of isolated teeth, vertebrae, and limb fragments that have helped refine its anatomy and confirm its placement near the base of Sauropodomorpha. The Newark Supergroup fossils are preserved in fluvial sandstones and mudstones, indicating rapid burial in river‑channel deposits.\n\nDiet  \nAnchisaurus was primarily herbivorous, feeding on low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and early conifers that dominated the Early Jurassic flora. Its leaf‑shaped teeth and modestly developed chewing surfaces suggest it could process soft plant material but was not equipped for heavy grinding. Some researchers propose occasional omnivory, citing the presence of small invertebrate remains in gut contents of related taxa, but the consensus is that plant matter made up the bulk of its diet.\n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Early Jurassic, the regions where Anchisaurus fossils are found were part of a rift valley system with a warm, semi‑arid climate. The landscape featured:  \n- River channels and floodplains that deposited the sandstones and mudstones preserving the bones.  \n- Open woodlands and scrubby vegetation interspersed with wet depressions supporting ferns and horsetails.  \n- Seasonal rainfall, leading to periodic flooding that could quickly entomb animals.  \n- A fauna that included early theropods (e.g., Dilophosaurus), small ornithischians, and various amphibians and early mammals, providing both competition for food and potential predators.  \n\nOverall, Anchisaurus was a modestly sized, agile herbivore that thrived in the early Jurassic riverine ecosystems of what is now eastern North America, representing an important evolutionary step toward the gigantic sauropods of later periods.",

    "output": "Ankylosaurus  \n\nSize:  \nAnkylosaurus was a heavily built quadrupedal dinosaur measuring about 6 to 8 metres (20–26 ft) in length. Its body mass is estimated at 4.5 to 6 tonnes. The animal stood roughly 1.5 m (5 ft) tall at the hips, with a low, wide torso protected by a thick armor plating.\n\nPeriod range:  \nIt lived during the Late Cretaceous, approximately 68 to 66 million years ago, in the very last stages of the dinosaur era.\n\nFossil locations:  \nFossils of Ankylosaurus have been recovered mainly from the Upper Cretaceous formations of western North America, especially the Hell Creek Formation in Montana and the Lance Formation in Wyoming. Isolated armor plates and tail clubs have also been found in the Two Medicine and the Judith River formations.\n\nPhysical description:  \nThe animal’s most striking feature was its extensive dermal armor: rows of bony plates (osteoderms) covered the back, sides, and tail, forming a protective “shield.” The plates varied in shape, some being flat and rectangular, others conical. At the end of the tail a massive bony club, formed by fused vertebrae and a pair of large osteoderms, could swing like a hammer. Ankylosaurus had a broad, low-slung body, a short neck, and a small head equipped with a beak-like mouth and leaf‑shaped teeth suited for cropping vegetation. Its limbs were stout and columnar, ending in broad, hoof‑like toes that helped support its massive weight.\n\nFossil record:  \nThe first Ankylosaurus specimens were described in 1908 by Barnum Brown. Since then, dozens of partial skeletons, isolated armor plates, tail clubs, and skull fragments have been catalogued. The most complete specimens include the nearly complete skull from the Hell Creek Formation (specimen USNM 7940) and a well‑preserved postcranial skeleton from the Lance Formation (specimen DMNH 21183). These fossils have allowed paleontologists to reconstruct the animal’s armor layout, tail‑club mechanics, and cranial anatomy in detail.\n\nDiet description:  \nAnkylosaurus was a herbivore that fed on low‑lying vegetation. Its beak could clip ferns, cycads, and other ground‑level plants, while the leaf‑shaped cheek teeth were adapted for grinding tough, fibrous material. The animal likely grazed on a variety of gymnosperms and early flowering plants that dominated the flood‑plain ecosystems of the Late Cretaceous.\n\nEnvironmental description:  \nAnkylosaurus inhabited the coastal plain and river‑valley environments of what is now the western interior of North America. The region was a warm, humid floodplain with a mix of dense forests, open woodlands, and swampy wetlands. Seasonal rivers created a mosaic of habitats, supporting abundant vegetation and a diverse fauna that included ceratopsians, hadrosaurs, tyrannosaurids, and various small mammals. The abundant plant life provided a steady food source, while the thick armor and tail club offered protection against the large predators that roamed the same ecosystems.",

    "output": "Anserimimus (meaning “goose mimic”) is a small, fast‑moving theropod belonging to the Ornithomimidae family.  \n\nSize  \n- Adult length: about 2.5–3.0 metres (8–10 ft).  \n- Height at the hip: roughly 1.0 metre (3.3 ft).  \n- Estimated body mass: 30–45 kg (66–100 lb).  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage, approximately 80 to 72 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Bayan Shireh Formation in western Mongolia, near the Gobi Desert.  \n- The type specimen (IGM 100/201) and several additional partial skeletons were discovered during joint Soviet‑Mongolian expeditions in the 1970s and 1980s.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Body plan typical of ornithomimids: long, slender hind limbs, a lightweight, bird‑like pelvis and a long, tapering tail for balance.  \n- Forearms were relatively short but ended in three-fingered hands with strong, curved claws, suggesting a grasping function.  \n- The skull was small, with a beak‑like, edentulous (tooth‑less) rostrum, large orbits and a crest of thin, elongated nasal bones that may have supported a soft‑tissue display structure.  \n- Skin impressions are lacking, but related ornithomimids are thought to have been covered in simple, filamentous feathers, so a feathered covering is plausible.  \n- The hind feet bore three weight‑bearing toes with blunt claws, indicating a primarily cursorial (running) lifestyle.  \n\nFossil record and preservation  \n- The primary material consists of a partial skeleton: vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, both femora, tibiae, fibulae, several metatarsals, and fragments of the forelimb.  \n- The bones are well‑preserved, showing fine cortical texture and limited deformation, allowing detailed measurements of limb proportions.  \n- No complete skull has been found, so reconstructions of the cranial anatomy rely on close relatives such as Gallimimus and Struthiomimus.  \n- The Bayan Shireh Formation yields a diverse assemblage of dinosaurs, providing a contextual framework for Anserimimus’ ecosystem.  \n\nDiet  \n- As an edentulous ornithomimid, Anserimimus most likely was omnivorous.  \n- The beak could have been used to crop low vegetation, fruits, seeds, and possibly small invertebrates.  \n- The robust foreclaw suggests occasional use in digging or manipulating food items, perhaps extracting insects from burrows or cracking open hard‑shelled fruits.  \n- Stable‑isotope analyses of related ornithomimids indicate a mixed diet, and the same inference is applied to Anserimimus.  \n\nEnvironmental setting  \n- The Bayan Shireh Formation represents a semi‑arid floodplain with seasonal rivers and lakes, bordered by low hills and occasional forested patches.  \n- Climate was warm with distinct wet and dry seasons, supporting a mosaic of vegetation: coniferous trees, ginkgoes, ferns, and flowering plants.  \n- The area hosted a rich dinosaur fauna, including large herbivores such as sauropods (e.g., *Saurolophus*), ceratopsians, and ankylosaurs, as well as predators like tyrannosaurids.  \n- Open, grassy‑to‑shrubby plains would have allowed Anserimimus to use its speed to forage over large areas while staying alert to larger carnivores.  \n\nOverall, Anserimimus was a small, agile, feather‑covered theropod adapted to a mixed diet and a dynamic floodplain environment, representing one of the more specialized members of the ornithomimid lineage in Late Cretaceous Asia.",

    "output": "**Antarctosaurus – Overview**  \n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 30–35 metres (98–115 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 6–7 metres (20–23 ft).  \n- Estimated mass: 40–55 tonnes, making it one of the largest known titanosaurs.  \n\n**Geological Time Range**  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian to Maastrichtian stages, approximately 84 to 66 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- Primary specimens have been recovered from the **Río Negro Province of Argentina**, chiefly in the **Allen Formation** and the **Mendoza Province** (e.g., the “Plaza Huincul” area).  \n- Additional fragmentary material attributed to Antarctosaurus has been reported from the **Lefipán Formation** in Patagonia and isolated teeth from the **Los Alamitos Formation**.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n- Belonged to the titanosaurian sauropods, characterized by a massive, barrel‑shaped torso supported by columnar limbs.  \n- Skull: poorly known; the few recovered fragments suggest a relatively small head with a blunt snout, typical of titanosaurs.  \n- Neck: long and flexible, composed of at least 13 cervical vertebrae, allowing the animal to browse at various heights.  \n- Tail: robust and heavily ossified, ending in a “whiplash” of elongated caudal vertebrae.  \n- Armor: some specimens show evidence of dermal ossicles (small bony plates) embedded in the skin, a feature seen in several derived titanosaurs.  \n- Limbs: forelimbs were shorter than the hind limbs but still massive; the femur could exceed 2 metres in length.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- The type species, *Antarctosaurus wichmannianus*, is known from a partial skeleton that includes a femur, tibia, vertebrae, and several pelvic bones.  \n- *Antarctosaurus giganteus* is represented by a more complete set of limb bones and a partial pelvis, though its taxonomic validity is debated.  \n- Isolated teeth, vertebrae, and osteoderms from various Argentine formations have been assigned to the genus, expanding the known geographic range but also complicating species-level identification.  \n- Overall, the fossil material is fragmentary, which has led to ongoing discussions about the exact number of species within the genus and their relationships to other South American titanosaurs such as *Argentinosaurus* and *Patagotitan*.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- As a large herbivore, Antarctosaurus fed on a variety of vegetation. Its long neck allowed it to browse both low‑lying ferns, cycads, and conifers, as well as higher‑up gymnosperm foliage.  \n- Tooth morphology (spatulate, leaf‑shaped teeth with coarse serrations) indicates a diet of tough, fibrous plant material that required extensive oral processing.  \n- The massive gut capacity typical of sauropods suggests a fermentative digestive system capable of extracting nutrients from low‑quality vegetation.  \n\n**Environmental Context**  \n- The Late Cretaceous of Patagonia was a semi‑arid to subtropical landscape with seasonal rainfall.  \n- The Allen Formation, where most Antarctosaurus fossils are found, consists of fluvial sandstones, mudstones, and occasional volcanic ash layers, indicating river‑plain environments with flood‑plain deposits, meandering channels, and occasional lakes.  \n- Vegetation would have been dominated by coniferous forests, podocarp‑like trees, and abundant ferns and horsetails along watercourses, providing ample browse for large sauropods.  \n- The region also supported a diverse fauna, including other titanosaurs, abelisaurid theropods, dromaeosaurids, and early mammals, creating a complex ecosystem in which Antarctosaurus occupied the role of a primary megaherbivore.  \n\n**Summary**  \nAntarctosaurus was a gigantic, late‑Cretaceous titanosaur from what is now Argentina. Measuring up to 35 metres in length and weighing over 40 tonnes, it roamed river‑plain environments rich in coniferous and fern vegetation. Although the fossil record is fragmentary, the available bones and teeth reveal a massive, long‑necked herbivore equipped with a robust body, dermal armor, and a diet focused on tough plant material. Its presence alongside other South American titanosaurs underscores the extraordinary diversity of giant sauropods that inhabited Gondwanan continents during the final stages of the dinosaur era.",

    "output": "Apatosaurus – Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 22–24 metres (72–79 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 4.5 m (15 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 20–30 tonnes, comparable to a modern blue‑whale calf.  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic, specifically the Kimmeridgian to Tithonian stages, approximately 154 to 150 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- First discovered in the western United States; most complete specimens come from the Morrison Formation of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.  \n- Additional fragmentary material has been reported from the Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania (though these are generally assigned to related diplodocids).  \n\nPhysical description  \n- A massive, long‑necked sauropod with a relatively short, robust tail.  \n- Neck composed of 13 elongated cervical vertebrae, giving a sweeping, low‑to‑the‑ground feeding posture.  \n- Body supported by a columnar, pillar‑like limb structure; forelimbs slightly shorter than hind limbs, creating a slight downward slope of the torso.  \n- Skin impressions suggest a covering of small, polygonal scales; no direct evidence of dermal armor.  \n- Tail ended in a tapered, whip‑like tip, possibly used for defensive thumping or communication.  \n- Skull was small relative to body size, with a blunt snout and leaf‑shaped teeth arranged in a simple, peg‑like row, ideal for stripping vegetation.  \n\nFossil record and discovery history  \n- First described in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh as “Brontosaurus,” later renamed Apatosaurus in 1879 after the earlier name “Apatosaurus ajax” was recognized as valid.  \n- Over 30 well‑preserved skeletons have been recovered, many as nearly complete articulated series, making Apatosaurus one of the best‑known Jurassic sauropods.  \n- Notable specimens include the “Apatosaurus louisae” (CM 3018) from the Carnegie Museum and the “Apatosaurus sp.” (BYU 9025) from the Utah Dinosaur Museum, both preserving extensive vertebral and limb material.  \n- Bone histology studies show relatively rapid growth rates, indicating that individuals reached near‑adult size within 15–20 years.  \n\nDiet  \n- Strictly herbivorous. Teeth were adapted for coarse browsing rather than precise cropping; they stripped foliage from conifers, cycads, ginkgos, and early fern-like plants.  \n- Likely fed at heights of 2–4 m, using its long neck to sweep across a wide feeding envelope without moving the massive body frequently.  \n- Coprolite (fossilized dung) evidence from Morrison deposits shows high plant fiber content and occasional traces of gastroliths, suggesting the use of stomach stones to grind tough plant material.  \n\nEnvironment  \n- Inhabited the semi‑arid floodplains and river valleys of the Morrison ecosystem, a landscape dominated by seasonal wet and dry periods.  \n- Vegetation consisted of dense conifer forests interspersed with open fern‑rich understories, providing abundant foliage for high‑browsing sauropods.  \n- Climate was warm temperate, with mean annual temperatures estimated around 20 °C (68 °F) and distinct wet seasons that supported lush growth along riverbanks.  \n- Co‑existing fauna included large theropods such as Allosaurus, smaller ornithischians like Camptosaurus, and other sauropods (Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus), indicating a complex, multi‑tiered herbivore community.  \n- Periodic volcanic activity deposited ash layers that later contributed to the fine‑grained mudstones preserving many of the Morrison fossils.  \n\nIn summary, Apatosaurus was a quintessential Late Jurassic sauropod: a gigantic, long‑necked herbivore that roamed the floodplains of western North America, feeding on the abundant coniferous and fern vegetation, and leaving behind a rich fossil record that continues to illuminate the biology and ecology of the era.",

    "output": "Aquilops americanus – Overview  \nSize:   Adult Aquilops was a small, bipedal ornithischian, measuring roughly 1.2 – 1.5 metres (4–5 ft) in total length. The skull was about 15 cm (6 in) long, and the animal is estimated to have weighed around 10–12 kg (22–26 lb).  \n\nGeological period:   Early Cretaceous, specifically the late Aptian to early Albian stages, about 113–108 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations:   All known specimens have been recovered from the Cloverly Formation of Montana, United States, near the town of Great Falls. The type specimen (MOR 605) and several additional partial skeletons were found in the same stratigraphic horizon, indicating a relatively localized population.  \n\nPhysical description:   \n- Skull: Short, low‑profile skull with a distinctive, sharply pointed beak (hence the name “Aquilops,” meaning “eagle face”). The premaxilla forms a narrow, keratin‑covered rhamphotheca.  \n- Dentition: Small, leaf‑shaped cheek teeth set far back in the jaws, suitable for cropping vegetation.  \n- Post‑cranial skeleton: Long, slender hind limbs with elongated metatarsals, suggesting good running ability. The forelimbs were short, ending in five‑digit hands with a reduced first digit.  \n- Tail: Moderately long, stiffened by ossified tendons, likely used for balance during rapid locomotion.  \n- Skin impressions: No direct skin fossils are known, but related basal neornithischians are thought to have had scaly skin with possible low, keeled scutes along the back.  \n\nFossil record:   \n- The holotype (MOR 605) consists of a nearly complete skull, partial vertebral column, pelvis, and both hind limbs.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated teeth, partial ribs, and a few limb fragments (MOR 607‑MOR 610).  \n- All specimens are preserved in fine‑grained sandstones, indicating rapid burial in a fluvial environment.  \n- No articulated skeletons have been found; the material is fragmentary but sufficient to diagnose Aquilops as the earliest known neornithischian from North America.  \n\nDiet:   \nAquilops was herbivorous, feeding on low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, horsetails, and early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to diversify in the Early Cretaceous. The beak would have been used to snip foliage, while the cheek teeth processed soft plant material. The small body size and cursorial limbs suggest it could move quickly to browse a wide area and escape predators.  \n\nEnvironment:   \nDuring the late Aptian‑early Albian, the region that is now Montana was part of a warm, semi‑arid floodplain crossed by meandering rivers and occasional lakes. The climate was seasonally wet, supporting a mosaic of open scrubland, riparian woodlands, and fern‑rich understories. Soils were relatively thin, and periodic volcanic ash falls contributed to the fine‑grained sediments that now preserve the fossils. Aquilops shared its habitat with early ceratopsians, small theropods (e.g., dromaeosaurids), and various freshwater fish and amphibians. The environment would have offered abundant low vegetation for a small herbivore, while the open terrain favored the development of speed and agility as anti‑predator strategies.",

    "output": "**Aragosaurus** – a medium‑large sauropod that once roamed the western foothills of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n**Size**  \n- Length: approximately 20 – 22 meters (65 – 72 ft) from snout to tip of tail.  \n- Height at the shoulder: about 5 meters (16 ft).  \n- Estimated mass: 14 – 16 tonnes.\n\n**Geological period**  \n- Late Jurassic, spanning roughly 155 – 145 million years ago (Kimmeridgian to Tithonian stages).  \n\n**Fossil locations**  \n- Primary discoveries in the “Río Cinca” formation near the town of Alquézar, province of Huesca, Aragon, Spain.  \n- Additional isolated teeth and vertebrae have been reported from the “Lusitanian” beds of central Portugal, suggesting a broader Iberian distribution.  \n\n**Physical description**  \nAragosaurus possessed the classic sauropod body plan but displayed several distinctive traits:  \n- A relatively elongated neck with 14 cervical vertebrae, each bearing deep lateral pneumatic openings that reduced neck weight.  \n- A modestly proportioned skull (≈1 m long) with a blunt, leaf‑shaped beak and low, spatulate teeth suited for cropping vegetation.  \n- Robust, columnar fore‑limbs with a pronounced deltopectoral crest on the humerus, indicating strong musculature for supporting its massive torso.  \n- A long, tapering tail equipped with a series of elongated chevron bones, likely used for balance and possibly as a defensive whip.  \n- Small, rounded osteoderms embedded in the skin along the dorsal midline, a feature rare among European sauropods and possibly serving as protection against large theropods.  \n\n**Fossil record**  \n- The first specimen (holotype ARS‑001) was uncovered in 1998 during a joint Spanish‑Portuguese field survey. It consists of a partial vertebral column (seven dorsal vertebrae, three caudal vertebrae), both scapulae, a left humerus, and fragments of the pelvis.  \n- Subsequent finds (1999‑2005) added a nearly complete left femur, several cervical vertebrae, and a partial skull roof, allowing a more accurate reconstruction of the skull and neck proportions.  \n- All material is curated at the Museo de Ciencias Naturales de Zaragoza and the Museu Nacional de História Natural e da Ciência, Lisbon.  \n- Radiometric dating of the surrounding volcanic ash layers places the strata at 148 ± 2 Ma.  \n\n**Diet**  \nAragosaurus was a high‑browsing herbivore. The shape of its teeth—broad, leaf‑like crowns with coarse enamel ridges—indicates a diet of soft coniferous needles, cycads, and large fern fronds. Microscopic wear patterns (striations oriented parallel to the tooth edges) suggest a primarily shearing action, consistent with cropping foliage rather than grinding. Stable‑isotope analysis of bone collagen points to a diet derived largely from plants growing in well‑drained, slightly acidic soils typical of flood‑plain forests.  \n\n**Environmental context**  \nDuring the Late Jurassic, the region that is now Aragon was part of a broad, low‑lying basin intersected by meandering rivers and occasional oxbow lakes. The climate was warm and semi‑arid, with seasonal rainfall that supported extensive conifer‑dominated woodlands on the higher terraces and lush fern‑and cycad thickets along the riverbanks. Periodic volcanic activity deposited ash layers that later facilitated precise dating of the fossil beds. Large theropods such as *Allosaurus* spp. and smaller carnivorous ornithischians shared the same habitats, while abundant freshwater fish and amphibians inhabited the waterways. The mosaic of open flood‑plains and dense forest patches provided ample foraging opportunities for a sauropod of Aragosaurus’s size, while the occasional osteoderms may have offered a modest defense against the apex predators of the time.",

    "output": "Aralosaurus (meaning “Aral Sea lizard”) is a relatively obscure hadrosaurid dinosaur known from a few fragmentary remains discovered in Central Asia.  \n\n**Size**  \n- Estimated total length: about 7–8 meters (23–26 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2 meters (6.5 ft).  \n- Body mass: estimated 2–3 tonnes, comparable to a medium‑sized hadrosaur such as Edmontosaurus.  \n\n**Geological period**  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage, approximately 84–78 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil locations**  \n- The only known material comes from the Bostobe Formation in western Kazakhstan, near the ancient shoreline of the Aral Sea.  \n- Additional isolated teeth and vertebral fragments attributed to Aralosaurus have been reported from nearby Turkmenistan deposits, but these remain tentative.  \n\n**Physical description**  \n- As a member of the Hadrosauridae, Aralosaurus possessed the characteristic duck‑bill snout formed by a broad, flattened rostrum.  \n- The skull, reconstructed from the partial cranial elements, shows a modest crest running along the midline of the nasal region, less pronounced than the elaborate crests of lambeosaurine relatives.  \n- The dentition consists of tightly packed dental batteries with hundreds of tiny grinding surfaces, ideal for processing plant material.  \n- Post‑cranial remains indicate a robust, quadrupedal stance with strong forelimbs capable of bearing weight, while the hind limbs were longer, allowing efficient bipedal locomotion when needed.  \n- The tail was relatively long and muscular, providing balance during rapid movement.  \n- Skin impressions are unknown, but based on close hadrosaur relatives, it likely bore a covering of small, polygonal scales interspersed with larger scutes along the flanks.  \n\n**Fossil record**  \n- The holotype (catalogued as “ZIN 123/456”) consists of a partial skull roof, a fragment of the maxilla, several dentary teeth, and a few vertebrae.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated limb bones and a handful of pedal phalanges recovered from the same stratigraphic horizon.  \n- The Bostobe Formation, where these fossils were found, is a well‑studied fluvial‑deltaic sequence that has also yielded other dinosaurs (e.g., tyrannosaurids, ankylosaurs) and a rich assemblage of fish, turtles, and crocodilians, helping to contextualize Aralosaurus within its ecosystem.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- Aralosaurus was a herbivore, feeding primarily on low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, horsetails, and the leaves of coniferous trees that dominated the floodplain.  \n- The complex dental batteries allowed it to grind tough plant fibers efficiently, while the broad snout could crop a wide swath of foliage in a single bite.  \n- Isotopic analysis of the tooth enamel (performed on the few available teeth) suggests a diet that included both C3 and C4 plants, indicating flexibility in feeding on both forest understory and more open, possibly semi‑arid vegetation.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- During the Campanian, the Bostobe region was a warm, humid floodplain situated near the western margin of the ancient Tethys Sea.  \n- The landscape comprised a mosaic of river channels, oxbow lakes, and extensive deltaic swamps interspersed with conifer‑dominated forests and open fern‑rich meadows.  \n- Seasonal rainfall created periodic flooding, depositing fine silts that later fossilized the remains of organisms living there.  \n- The climate was subtropical, with average temperatures likely ranging from 20 °C to 30 °C, and a pronounced wet season that supported abundant plant growth.  \n- Predators such as large tyrannosaurids and dromaeosaurids would have hunted in the same habitats, while smaller theropods and crocodyliforms occupied the waterways.  \n\nIn summary, Aralosaurus was a medium‑sized, duck‑bill herbivore that roamed the lush, river‑dominated plains of Late Cretaceous Central Asia. Its limited but informative fossil material provides a glimpse into the diversity of hadrosaurids that inhabited the margins of the ancient Aral Sea and the ecological dynamics of those flood‑plain ecosystems.",

    "output": "Archaeoceratops is a small, early member of the ceratopsian lineage that lived during the Late Cretaceous, roughly between 84 and 71 million years ago. The only confirmed specimens come from the Bayan Shireh Formation of central Mongolia, a region that today forms part of the Gobi Desert. The type species, Archaeoceratops oshimai, was described from material recovered in the 1990s near the town of Bayanzag, and a handful of additional skull fragments and partial post‑cranial elements have since been assigned to the genus, giving paleontologists a modest but useful sample of its anatomy.\n\nSize and build  \nAdult individuals were modest in stature, measuring about 1.5 metres (5 ft) in total length and standing roughly 0.5–0.6 metres (1.6–2 ft) tall at the hips. Body mass is estimated at 50–70 kg (110–150 lb). The animal had a compact, quadrupedal frame with sturdy limbs, a short tail, and a low, broad skull that bore a modest frill at the back of the skull but lacked the large horns seen in later ceratopsids.\n\nPhysical description  \nThe skull was about 20 cm long and featured a beaked, parrot‑like rostrum adapted for cropping vegetation. The frill was thin and unornamented, extending only a short distance behind the skull roof. No prominent brow or nasal horns are present; instead, the animal possessed small, low ridges that may have served as attachment points for facial muscles. The body was covered in a coat of simple, filamentous feathers or proto‑feathers, a trait inferred from related basal ceratopsians and the general trend toward integumentary coverings in early ornithischians. The limbs were robust, with the forelimbs slightly shorter than the hindlimbs, suggesting a primarily quadrupedal gait but with enough flexibility for occasional bipedal rearing.\n\nFossil record  \nTo date, fewer than a dozen specimens have been catalogued, most of them consisting of isolated skull elements (maxillae, jugals, and frill fragments) and a few partial post‑cranial bones (humeri, femora, and vertebrae). The most complete find is a nearly complete skull with associated lower jaw, which has provided the bulk of the diagnostic features for the genus. All material comes from fluvial sandstones and mudstones of the Bayan Shireh Formation, indicating that the animals were buried rapidly in river‑associated floodplain sediments.\n\nDiet  \nArchaeoceratops was a herbivore that fed on low‑lying vegetation. Its beak and leaf‑shaped cheek teeth were well suited for cropping and grinding soft plant material such as ferns, horsetails, and the leaves of low‑bush conifers and cycads that dominated the Late Cretaceous flora of the region. The lack of high‑crowned teeth suggests it did not specialize in processing very tough, fibrous plants, but rather relied on a diet of relatively tender foliage.\n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, the area that is now central Mongolia was a warm, semi‑arid landscape punctuated by river channels, floodplains, and occasional forested patches. Seasonal rains created lush riparian zones where ferns, horsetails, and a variety of gymnosperms grew in abundance. Open, drier uplands supported sparse coniferous woodlands and scrubby vegetation. The climate was likely temperate to subtropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons, providing a mosaic of habitats that could support a range of herbivorous dinosaurs, including the modestly sized Archaeoceratops.",

    "output": "Archaeopteryx – Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Average wingspan: about 0.5 m (1.6 ft).  \n- Body length from tip of beak to tail tip: roughly 0.4 m (1.3 ft).  \n- Weight estimated at 0.5–1 kg (1–2 lb).  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Late Jurassic, approximately 150–148 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Solnhofen limestone deposits in southern Bavaria, Germany.  \n- The fine‑grained lagoonal limestone of the Solnhofen archipelago preserves delicate skeletal details and occasional feather impressions.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Small, bipedal theropod with a long, feathered tail and a short, stiffened fore‑limb bearing well‑developed flight feathers.  \n- Skull: lightly built, with a toothed, slightly curved beak; large, forward‑facing eyes suggesting good vision.  \n- Limbs: hind limbs end in a reversed hallux (big toe) capable of grasping, while the fore‑limbs have a semi‑mobile wrist joint (the “semilunate” carpal) that allowed the wing to fold.  \n- Feathers: asymmetrical primary feathers on the wings, symmetrical down‑like feathers covering the body and tail; a fringe of feathers on the legs is also present in some specimens.  \n- Skeleton: a mixture of primitive dinosaurian traits (e.g., a long bony tail, teeth, clawed fingers) and avian features (wishbone, fused hand bones).  \n\nFossil record  \n- To date, about a dozen well‑preserved specimens have been described, ranging from isolated feathers to nearly complete skeletons.  \n- The most famous specimen, “London Specimen” (BMNH 37001), includes a nearly complete skeleton with impressions of wing feathers.  \n- Other notable finds include the “Berlin Specimen” (SMNK PAL 4784) with exceptionally preserved feather detail, and the “Solnhofen Specimen” (JME‑001) which shows a fully articulated skeleton in life‑like posture.  \n- The Solnhofen limestone’s anoxic lagoonal environment contributed to the extraordinary preservation of soft tissues, allowing scientists to study feather microstructure and pigmentation.  \n\nDiet  \n- Carnivorous/omnivorous. The presence of sharp, recurved teeth indicates a diet of small vertebrates such as lizards, early mammals, and possibly juvenile dinosaurs.  \n- Gut contents and coprolite evidence are scarce, but the beak and claw morphology suggest it could also have captured insects and other invertebrates.  \n- Some researchers propose opportunistic scavenging of carcasses, given its ability to glide short distances and perch on trees.  \n\nEnvironment  \n- Lived in a subtropical archipelago of islands and shallow lagoons that covered what is now southern Germany.  \n- Climate was warm and humid, with seasonal variations that supported lush vegetation, including conifers, cycads, ferns, and early flowering plants.  \n- The landscape featured a mosaic of coastal mangrove‑like swamps, lagoonal mudflats, and forested islands.  \n- Abundant water bodies attracted fish, amphibians, and a diversity of insects, providing a rich food web for a small, agile predator.  \n- The open lagoonal waters and scattered trees offered both hunting grounds and perching sites, facilitating the evolution of flight‑related adaptations seen in Archaeopteryx.

    "output": "Archaeornithomimus (meaning “ancient bird mimic”) is a theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous, roughly between 84 and 70 million years ago, in what is now Mongolia.  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 4.5 – 5 meters (15 – 16 feet) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 1.2 meters (4 feet).  \n- Weight: estimated 250 – 300 kilograms (550 – 660 lb).  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Upper Cretaceous, Campanian to Maastrichtian stages, spanning roughly 84–70 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- The only known specimens have been recovered from the Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert, particularly near the site of the “Barun Goyot” and “Nemegt” localities in southern Mongolia.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Archaeornithomimus possessed a slender, gracile build typical of ornithomimids, with long, powerful hind limbs adapted for fast running.  \n- The skull was lightly built, elongated, and tooth‑less, bearing a beak‑like rostrum that resembled that of modern ostriches.  \n- The forearms were relatively long, ending in three-fingered hands with slender claws, likely used for grasping or manipulating food.  \n- Its tail was stiffened by elongated chevrons, providing balance during rapid locomotion.  \n- Skin impressions suggest a covering of simple, non‑ornamented scales, possibly interspersed with small feather-like filaments along the forearms and tail, as inferred from related ornithomimid taxa.  \n- The overall posture was bipedal, with a center of mass positioned over the hips, allowing efficient cursorial movement.  \n\nFossil records  \n- The holotype (IGM 100/201) consists of a partial skeleton including a nearly complete skull, cervical and dorsal vertebrae, pelvis, and portions of the hind limbs.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated femora, tibiae, and foot bones recovered from the same formation, which have helped refine estimates of size and locomotor ability.  \n- No complete articulated skeleton has yet been found, but the existing elements are well preserved, showing fine details of the cranial sutures and limb morphology.  \n\nDiet description  \n- As a tooth‑less ornithomimid, Archaeornithomimus is interpreted as an omnivore or opportunistic herbivore.  \n- The beak would have been effective for cropping low vegetation, seeds, and possibly soft‑bodied invertebrates.  \n- Gut content fossils are absent, but the morphology of the jaw and the presence of gastroliths in related species suggest a diet that included plant material supplemented by small animals such as insects, lizards, or hatchling dinosaurs.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \n- The Nemegt Formation represents a fluvial plain with meandering rivers, flood‑plains, and occasional lake deposits.  \n- Climate during the Late Cretaceous in this region was semi‑arid to sub‑humid, with seasonal rainfall that supported a mosaic of vegetation: riverine forests of conifers and ginkgos, open scrublands of flowering plants, and patches of fern‑rich understory.  \n- The ecosystem hosted a diverse dinosaur fauna, including large theropods (e.g., Tarbosaurus), massive herbivores (e.g., Saurolophus, Nemegtosaurus), and smaller ornithischians, providing both potential predators and a variety of food sources for Archaeornithomimus.  \n- The presence of abundant water sources and varied plant life would have offered ample foraging opportunities for a fast‑moving, adaptable omnivore such as Archaeornithomimus.",

    "output": "**Argentinosaurus – Overview**\n\n**Size**  \nArgentinosaurus is one of the largest known land animals ever to walk the Earth. Estimates based on the few recovered vertebrae and limb bones place its total length at roughly 30–35 meters (98–115 feet) and its shoulder height at about 7 meters (23 feet). Mass estimates vary widely because of the fragmentary nature of the material, but most recent volumetric models suggest a weight between 70 and 100 tonnes (154,000–220,000 lb).\n\n**Geological Period**  \nThe species lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically in the Campanian to Maastrichtian stages, about 97 to 94 million years ago. This places Argentinosaurus toward the very end of the age of dinosaurs, just before the mass extinction event at the Cretaceous‑Paleogene boundary.\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \nAll known Argentinosaurus material comes from the Neuquén Province of north‑western Argentina, in the Patagonia region. The most important site is the “Plaza Huincul” and “Cerro Barcino” formations of the Río Limay Group, where a handful of gigantic dorsal vertebrae, a partial femur, and several caudal (tail) vertebrae were uncovered in the early 1990s. The fossils are housed primarily at the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales in Buenos Aires.\n\n**Physical Description**  \n- **Skeleton:** The animal possessed an extremely robust axial skeleton. The dorsal vertebrae are massive, with deep pleurocoels (air‑filled cavities) that reduced weight while maintaining strength. The femur, though incomplete, indicates a thick, columnar limb capable of supporting enormous loads.  \n- **Body Shape:** Like other titanosaurs, Argentinosaurus had a long, low‑slung neck, a relatively small head (estimated 1 meter in length) with a beak‑like mouth, and a massive, barrel‑shaped torso. Its tail was long and muscular, likely used for balance.  \n- **Skin and Covering:** No direct skin impressions have been found, but related titanosaurs show evidence of small, pebble‑like osteoderms embedded in the dermis, suggesting Argentinosaurus may have had a lightly armored hide.  \n- **Limbs:** Four pillar‑like limbs, with the forelimbs slightly shorter than the hind limbs, gave the animal a slightly sloping back. The hands bore five digits, the outermost reduced to a small claw.  \n\n**Fossil Record and History of Discovery**  \nThe first remains were reported in 1987 by Argentine paleontologists José Bonaparte and Rodolfo Coria, who recognized the extraordinary size of the vertebrae. Subsequent expeditions in 1993 recovered additional material, allowing a more complete (though still fragmentary) reconstruction. Because only a few bones are known, Argentinosaurus is classified as a “nomen dubium” by some researchers, but most agree that the size and morphology of the recovered elements are distinct enough to warrant a separate genus. The species name, *Argentinosaurus huinculensis*, honors the country of discovery and the nearby town of Huincul.\n\n**Diet**  \nArgentinosaurus was a herbivore, feeding on the abundant vegetation of Late Cretaceous Patagonia. Its small, leaf‑shaped teeth and beak were adapted for stripping foliage rather than chewing; food was likely processed in the massive gut, where microbial fermentation broke down tough plant material. Likely food sources included conifers, cycads, ginkgos, and the early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to dominate the landscape. The sheer size of the animal would have allowed it to reach high into the canopy, accessing foliage unavailable to smaller herbivores.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Campanian‑Maastrichtian, the Neuquén Basin was a semi‑arid to subtropical floodplain dotted with river channels, lakes, and occasional coastal plains. The climate was warm with seasonal rainfall, supporting a mosaic of vegetation: open fern‑ and cycad‑dominated woodlands interspersed with pockets of coniferous forest and emerging angiosperm thickets. Seasonal flooding created rich alluvial soils that promoted rapid plant growth, providing ample forage for gigantic sauropods. The region also hosted a diverse dinosaur fauna, including large theropods such as *Mapusaurus* and smaller ornithopods, as well as crocodilians, turtles, and early mammals, indicating a complex ecosystem in which Argentinosaurus was the dominant megaherbivore.",

    "output": "**Arrhinoceratops Overview**  \n\nArrhinoceratops (“no‑nose horn face”) is a medium‑large ceratopsian that lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now North America.  \n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 5.5–6.0 metres (18–20 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 1.8–2.0 m (6 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 2.5–3.5 tonnes, comparable to a modern rhinoceros.  \n\n**Geological Time Range**  \n- Late Campanian to early Maastrichtian stages, approximately 75 to 70 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- First described from the Two Medicine Formation of north‑western Montana, USA.  \n- Additional specimens have been recovered from the Judith River and Hell Creek formations (Montana and North Dakota) and from the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta, Canada.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \nArrhinoceratops possessed the classic ceratopsian body plan: a robust, quadrupedal frame with a large, bony frill extending from the back of the skull and a modest nasal horn. Unlike some later ceratopsids, it lacked a prominent nasal horn (“arrhino” meaning “no nose horn”), though a small, low‑profile protuberance may have been present. The brow horns were relatively short and stout, curving slightly outward. The frill was broad and ornamented with a series of low, rounded epoccipitals along its margin, giving it a slightly scalloped edge. The beak was sharp and keratin‑covered, suited for cropping vegetation, while the cheek teeth were large, leaf‑shaped, and arranged in tightly packed dental batteries capable of grinding tough plant material. The limbs were sturdy, with the forelimbs slightly shorter than the hindlimbs, indicating a primarily quadrupedal stance but capable of brief bipedal rearing if needed.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- The holotype (CMN 880) consists of a partial skull with frill and several postcranial elements.  \n- Numerous additional skull fragments, isolated frill pieces, and partial skeletons have been catalogued in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the Royal Tyrrell Museum, and the Montana Museum of Natural History.  \n- Bonebeds in the Two Medicine Formation have yielded multiple individuals of varying ages, providing insight into growth stages and population structure.  \n- Histological studies of limb bones show relatively rapid growth rates during juvenile stages, slowing as individuals approached adult size.  \n\n**Diet**  \nArrhinoceratops was a herbivore that fed on low‑lying to mid‑height vegetation. Its dental batteries were adapted for processing fibrous plant material such as ferns, cycads, and the leaves of coniferous trees. Microwear analysis of the teeth indicates a diet dominated by coarse, abrasive foliage, suggesting it may have also consumed occasional seeds or fruit from gymnosperms. The beak allowed precise cropping of vegetation, while the powerful jaw muscles generated the force needed to crush tough plant fibers.  \n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Late Cretaceous, the regions where Arrhinoceratops fossils are found were part of a warm, semi‑arid floodplain ecosystem. The climate was relatively mild with seasonal precipitation, supporting a mosaic of habitats:  \n\n- **River Channels and Floodplains:** Meandering rivers deposited the sandstones and mudstones that now preserve the fossils. These waterways supported riparian vegetation, including horsetails and water‑logged ferns.  \n- **Forested Areas:** Open coniferous forests of araucarian and podocarp trees dotted the landscape, interspersed with pockets of deciduous angiosperms that were beginning to diversify.  \n- **Coastal Plains:** In some parts of the Two Medicine Formation, the area was close to the Western Interior Seaway, providing a humid influence and occasional marine incursions.  \n- **Faunal Community:** Arrhinoceratops shared its world with other ceratopsians (e.g., Styracosaurus, Pachyrhinosaurus), hadrosaurs, ankylosaurs, tyrannosaurids, dromaeosaurids, and various crocodyliforms. Competition for plant resources and predation pressure from large theropods likely shaped its social behavior, possibly favoring herd living for protection.  \n\nOverall, Arrhinoceratops was a well‑adapted, mid‑sized ceratopsian that thrived in the diverse, dynamic ecosystems of Late Cretaceous western North America, leaving a modest but informative fossil record that helps paleontologists understand ceratopsid evolution and paleoecology.",

    "output": "Atlascopcosaurus (meaning “Atlas‑copcosaurus” after the Atlas Copco mining company that helped fund the excavation) is a little‑known ornithopod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of what is now southeastern Australia.  \n\nSize  \nAdult individuals are estimated to have reached about 2.5–3.0 metres (8–10 ft) in length and stood roughly 1 metre (3 ft) tall at the hip. Body mass is thought to have been in the range of 70–100 kg, comparable to a modern large goat.  \n\nPeriod range  \nThe species lived during the Barremian to early Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous, approximately 129–115 million years ago.  \n\nFossil location  \nAll known material comes from the Wonthaggi Formation near the town of Wonthaggi in Victoria, Australia. The fossils were recovered from a series of fluvial sandstones and mudstones that were once part of a low‑lying river plain.  \n\nPhysical description  \nAtlascopcosaurus was a bipedal‑to‑quadrupedal herbivore with a compact, robust build. The skull, reconstructed from fragmentary maxillae and dentary pieces, was relatively short and low‑set, bearing a beak‑like rostrum and rows of leaf‑shaped cheek teeth with coarse serrations. The forelimbs were short but well‑muscled, ending in five‑digit hands with a partially opposable thumb, suggesting the ability to grasp vegetation. The hind limbs were longer, with a strong femur and a slender tibia, indicating decent running ability. The tail was stiffened by elongated neural spines, providing balance while moving on two legs. Skin impressions are lacking, but related ornithopods suggest a covering of small, non‑overlapping scales, possibly interspersed with simple filamentous structures.  \n\nFossil records  \nThe holotype (specimen NMV P186123) consists of a partial right maxilla with several teeth, a fragmentary left femur, and a series of caudal vertebrae. Additional referred material includes isolated dentary fragments, a partial pelvis, and a handful of isolated pedal phalanges, all housed at the Museums Victoria collection. The material is relatively sparse, making Atlascopcosaurus one of the most fragmentarily known Australian dinosaurs, but the preserved teeth display a distinctive wear pattern that helps separate it from contemporaneous iguanodontians.  \n\nDiet description  \nAs an herbivore, Atlascopcosaurus fed on low‑lying vegetation. The leaf‑shaped, moderately high‑crowned teeth with fine serrations are suited for cropping ferns, cycads, and the soft fronds of early conifers. Microwear analysis of the teeth shows a predominance of fine scratches, indicating a diet of relatively soft plant material, possibly supplemented by occasional tougher shoots when they were seasonally available.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \nDuring the Early Cretaceous, the region that is now southeastern Australia lay at high southern latitudes (around 70° S) and experienced a cool, temperate climate with strong seasonal variation in daylight. The Wonthaggi area was dominated by a mosaic of floodplains, meandering rivers, and shallow lakes surrounded by dense fern‑ and cycad‑rich forests. Volcanic ash falls occasionally blanketed the landscape, contributing to the fine‑grained sediments that later preserved the fossils. The environment supported a diverse fauna, including small theropods, early mammals, and a variety of aquatic reptiles, creating a dynamic ecosystem in which Atlascopcosaurus likely moved in small herds, browsing the abundant low vegetation while staying alert to predators.",

    "output": "Atrociraptor (meaning “terrible thief”) is a small, carnivorous theropod dinosaur known from the Late Cretaceous of North America.  \n\nSize  \n- Adult length: about 2.5 – 3 metres (8–10 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 0.8 metres (2.5 ft).  \n- Estimated weight: 30–45 kilograms (65–100 lb).  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Lived during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 77 to 73 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Judith River Formation in north‑central Montana, United States.  \n- Additional isolated teeth and fragmentary bones have been reported from the nearby Two Medicine Formation, suggesting a slightly broader geographic range within the western interior basin.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Atrociraptor possessed a slender, bipedal body with a long, stiff tail that acted as a counter‑balance.  \n- The skull was relatively short and deep, bearing a set of robust, recurved teeth with serrated edges, ideal for slicing flesh.  \n- The forelimbs were short but ended in a strong, three‑fingered hand; the second digit bore a large, curved claw reminiscent of that seen in dromaeosaurids.  \n- Its hind limbs were long and built for speed, with a partially arctometatarsalian foot (the third metatarsal pinched between the second and fourth).  \n- The skin likely bore a covering of small, non‑overlapping scales, and a modest crest of elongated dorsal spines may have been present along the neck and back, though no direct evidence of such spines has yet been found.  \n\nFossil records  \n- The holotype (specimen DMNH 2015‑001) consists of a partial skull, several cervical vertebrae, a left femur, and a handful of fore‑ and hind‑limb elements.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated teeth (characterized by a distinctive “D-shaped” cross‑section) and a partial pelvis recovered in 2018.  \n- All specimens are relatively well preserved, allowing paleontologists to reconstruct the braincase and infer sensory capabilities; the inner ear suggests good balance and hearing.  \n- No complete skeleton has yet been found, so reconstructions rely on comparisons with closely related dromaeosaurids such as Dromaeosaurus and Saurornitholestes.  \n\nDiet description  \n- As a mid‑sized predator, Atrociraptor likely hunted small to medium vertebrates, including juvenile ceratopsians, ornithopods, and other small theropods.  \n- Its sharp, laterally compressed teeth and powerful jaw muscles indicate a diet of flesh, but the presence of gastroliths in some specimens hints that it may have also ingested bone fragments or swallowed small prey whole.  \n- The enlarged second toe claw could have been used to deliver slashing wounds or to grip struggling prey, similar to the “killing claw” seen in other dromaeosaurids.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \n- The Judith River Formation during the Campanian was a flood‑plain ecosystem with a warm, semi‑arid climate.  \n- Rivers and meandering streams created a mosaic of riparian woodlands, open coniferous forests, and grassy flood‑plain meadows.  \n- Vegetation was dominated by conifers, cycads, ferns, and early flowering plants, providing both cover and a diverse herbivore community.  \n- Large herbivores such as the hadrosaurid Maiasaura, ceratopsians like Brachylophosaurus, and ankylosaurs roamed the same habitats, offering ample prey for a predator of Atrociraptor’s size.  \n- The area also supported a variety of smaller vertebrates—lizards, early mammals, and amphibians—adding to the potential food sources.  \n- Seasonal flooding would have created temporary lakes and wetlands, attracting fish and amphibians, which may have been opportunistically taken by Atrociraptor when available.  \n\nOverall, Atrociraptor was a swift, agile predator adapted to a dynamic, river‑dominated landscape, occupying a niche between the larger apex predators and the smaller, more specialized theropods of Late Cretaceous Montana.",

    "output": "Aucasaurus – Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 7–8 metres (23–26 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2.5 m (8 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 1.5–2 tonnes.  \n\nGeological period  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian to Maastrichtian stages, approximately 84 to 70 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Cerro Barcino Formation in the Chubut Province of Patagonia, Argentina.  \n- The most complete skeleton (specimen MUCPv‑417) was discovered near the town of Auca Mahuida, which gave the genus its name (“Auca” meaning “spear” in the local Mapuche language).  \n\nPhysical description  \n- A member of the Abelisauridae, Aucasaurus possessed a short, deep skull with a pronounced, bony crest running along the top of the snout.  \n- The jaws were heavily built, bearing a reduced number of large, serrated teeth (about 12 per side) that were set deep in the maxilla.  \n- The forelimbs were extremely reduced, even more so than in its close relative Carnotaurus: each arm was only about 30 cm long, ending in a single claw.  \n- The neck and torso were robust, with massive neural arches and thick, fused dorsal vertebrae.  \n- The tail was muscular and likely used for balance during rapid turns.  \n- Skin impressions from related abelisaurids suggest a covering of small, non‑overlapping scales, possibly with low, bony osteoderms along the back.  \n\nFossil record  \n- Only a handful of partial skeletons are known, the most complete being the nearly complete skull and partial post‑cranial skeleton described in 2009.  \n- Earlier finds in the 1970s consisted of isolated teeth and vertebrae that were later attributed to Aucasaurus.  \n- The scarcity of specimens makes precise growth series unknown, but bone histology from the available material indicates a relatively fast growth rate typical of large theropods.  \n\nDiet  \n- As a large carnivore, Aucasaurus was an apex predator in its ecosystem.  \n- Its robust jaws and serrated teeth were suited for delivering powerful bites to flesh and crushing bone.  \n- Likely prey included medium‑sized ornithopods (such as Gasparinisaura), smaller titanosaurs, and possibly juvenile sauropods that wandered near water sources.  \n- The reduced forelimbs suggest it relied on its massive skull and neck muscles rather than grasping prey, delivering killing bites with its jaws.  \n\nEnvironment  \n- The Cerro Barcino Formation represents a semi‑arid to subtropical floodplain environment during the Late Cretaceous.  \n- The landscape was a mosaic of river channels, oxbow lakes, and low‑lying vegetated floodplains, interspersed with occasional volcanic ash layers.  \n- Vegetation consisted of conifers, early flowering plants (angiosperms), ferns, and cycads, providing ample browse for herbivorous dinosaurs.  \n- Climate was warm with seasonal rainfall, supporting a diverse dinosaur fauna that included titanosaurs, hadrosaur‑like ornithopods, other abelisaurids, and small theropods.  \n- This setting offered Aucasaurus both abundant prey and open spaces for ambush hunting, while the occasional water bodies could have been used for cooling and as hunting grounds.  \n\nIn summary, Aucasaurus was a medium‑sized, heavily built abelisaurid theropod that roamed the Late Cretaceous floodplains of Patagonia. Its distinctive skull crest, reduced forelimbs, and powerful bite made it a formidable predator within a warm, river‑dominated ecosystem.",

    "output": "Austrosaurus is a relatively little‑known sauropod dinosaur that lived in what is now southeastern Australia during the Early Cretaceous.  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 18–20 metres (60–65 ft) from head to tail.  \n- Height: roughly 5 metres (16 ft) at the shoulder when the neck was raised.  \n- Mass: estimated between 15 and 20 tonnes.  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Lived approximately between 115 and 100 million years ago, spanning the late Aptian to early Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous.  \n\nFossil location  \n- The only material assigned to Austrosaurus has been recovered from the Eumeralla Formation near the town of Inverloch in the state of Victoria, Australia. The site is part of the Otway Group, a series of coastal and fluvial deposits that preserve a rich assemblage of Cretaceous vertebrates.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- As a member of the titanosauriforms, Austrosaurus possessed a long, columnar neck and a massive, barrel‑shaped torso supported by robust, pillar‑like limbs.  \n- The vertebrae show deep lateral depressions (pleurocoels) that would have been filled with air sacs, reducing the animal’s weight.  \n- The tail was long and tapering, ending in a small, possibly club‑like tip.  \n- The skull is unknown; however, based on close relatives, it would have been relatively small, with a blunt snout and leaf‑shaped teeth suited for stripping vegetation.  \n- The limb bones are thick and heavily built, indicating a weight‑bearing adaptation for supporting a huge body on relatively soft flood‑plain sediments.  \n\nFossil records  \n- The type specimen (BMNH R3710) consists of a partial dorsal vertebra, a fragmentary caudal vertebra, and several isolated limb elements, including a humerus and a femur.  \n- Additional isolated teeth and vertebral fragments have been referred to the genus from the same formation, but no more complete skeleton has yet been discovered.  \n- Because the material is fragmentary, the genus has been considered a “wastebasket” taxon by some researchers, and future finds may either confirm its distinctiveness or reassign the bones to other Australian sauropods.  \n\nDiet description  \n- Austrosaurus was a herbivore that fed on the abundant low‑lying and mid‑canopy vegetation of the Cretaceous coastal plain.  \n- Its presumed leaf‑shaped, spatulate teeth would have been efficient at stripping ferns, cycads, conifers, and early flowering plants (angiosperms) from stems and branches.  \n- The long neck allowed it to browse a wide vertical range without moving its massive body, enabling it to reach both ground‑level ferns and higher conifer foliage.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \n- During the Early Cretaceous, the region that is now Victoria was part of a warm, humid coastal plain situated near the southern margin of the Gondwanan supercontinent.  \n- The Eumeralla Formation records a mosaic of river channels, flood‑plains, lagoons and shallow marine incursions, indicating a landscape of meandering rivers bordered by dense vegetation.  \n- The climate was subtropical to temperate, with high rainfall supporting lush fern‑ and cycad‑dominated forests, interspersed with conifer stands and the earliest angiosperm shrubs.  \n- Seasonal fluctuations may have produced periodic flooding, creating rich alluvial soils that promoted rapid plant growth, providing ample food for large herbivores like Austrosaurus.  \n- The same ecosystems hosted a variety of other dinosaurs (small theropods, ornithopods), early mammals, crocodilians, and abundant fish and invertebrates, forming a diverse Cretaceous community.",

    "output": "Avaceratops (meaning “bird-like horned face”) is a relatively small member of the ceratopsian dinosaurs, known from the Late Cretaceous of what is now North America.  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 4.5–5.0 metres (15–16.5 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 1.5 m (5 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 1–1.5 tonnes.  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 77 to 75 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- The only known specimens have been recovered from the Two Medicine Formation in north‑western Montana, United States.  \n- Additional fragmentary material possibly attributable to Avaceratops has been reported from the Judith River Formation (also in Montana) but remains unconfirmed.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- As a basal centrosaurine, Avaceratops possessed a short, robust frill with modest ornamentation; the frill bore a few low, rounded epoccipitals rather than the large spikes seen in later centrosaurines.  \n- The skull was relatively narrow and elongated, giving it a “bird‑like” appearance that inspired its name.  \n- It had a modest nasal horn, about 10 cm (4 in) long, and a small brow horn on each side of the skull.  \n- The body was built for quadrupedal locomotion, with sturdy forelimbs and a strong, muscular tail.  \n- The dentition consisted of a battery of leaf‑shaped cheek teeth arranged in rows, suitable for grinding plant material.  \n\nFossil record  \n- The holotype (specimen MOR 692) consists of a partial skull roof, frill fragments, and several post‑cranial elements, discovered in 1995.  \n- Additional referred material includes a partial braincase (MOR 693) and a few limb bones, which together give a fairly complete picture of the animal’s anatomy despite the scarcity of complete skeletons.  \n- All specimens are housed at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana, and have been the basis for several phylogenetic analyses that place Avaceratops near the base of the Centrosaurinae.  \n\nDiet  \n- Avaceratops was a herbivore that fed on low‑lying vegetation.  \n- Its dental batteries were adapted for shearing and grinding tough, fibrous plants such as ferns, cycads, and the leaves of early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were abundant in the Campanian floodplains.  \n- The relatively modest size of its horns and frill suggests it relied more on feeding efficiency and possibly herd behavior than on defensive weaponry.  \n\nEnvironment  \n- The Two Medicine Formation represents a semi‑arid, seasonal landscape of river channels, floodplains, and occasional lake margins.  \n- Climate was warm with distinct wet and dry seasons, supporting a mosaic of vegetation: open coniferous woodlands, fern‑rich understories, and patches of flowering plants.  \n- Avaceratops shared its habitat with other dinosaurs such as the hadrosaurid Maiasaura, the tyrannosaurid Daspletosaurus, and smaller theropods, as well as a variety of crocodyliforms, turtles, and early mammals.  \n- Periodic volcanic ash falls, recorded in the sedimentary layers, contributed to the preservation of the fossils and indicate that the region experienced occasional volcanic activity.  \n\nIn summary, Avaceratops was a medium‑sized, early centrosaurine ceratopsian that lived on the floodplains of Late Cretaceous Montana, feeding on a diet of low‑lying plants and inhabiting a dynamic, seasonally wet environment alongside a diverse dinosaur fauna.",

    "output": "Avimimus (meaning “bird mimic”) is a small, feather‑covered theropod dinosaur that lived in the Late Cretaceous of what is now Mongolia.  \n\n**Size**  \n- Adult length: about 1.5–2.0 metres (5–6.5 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 0.6 m (2 ft).  \n- Body mass: estimated 15–20 kg (33–44 lb).  \n\n**Geological time range**  \n- Lived during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 71 to 75 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil localities**  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia, especially near the sites of Nemegt Basin and the “Flaming Cliffs” (Bayanzag).  \n\n**Physical description**  \n- Avimimus possessed a lightweight, gracile skeleton with long, slender hind limbs built for fast running.  \n- The forelimbs were unusually long for a non‑avian theropod, ending in a hand with three functional digits, each bearing a large claw.  \n- The skull was small and elongated, with a beak‑like, tooth‑less rostrum and large, forward‑facing eyes suggesting good binocular vision.  \n- Impressions of filamentous feathers have been found on the forearms, tail base and possibly the hind limbs, indicating a plumage that may have been used for display or thermoregulation.  \n- The tail was relatively short and stiffened by elongated chevrons, providing balance during rapid locomotion.  \n\n**Fossil record**  \n- The first material, a partial skeleton (specimen IGM 100/201), was described in 1981 by Kurzanov and later assigned to a new genus and species, Avimimus portentosus, in 1987.  \n- Subsequent finds include more complete postcranial material (IGM 100/2012, IGM 100/2013) and isolated skull fragments that have clarified the beak structure.  \n- No complete skull has yet been recovered, but the available cranial fragments confirm the loss of teeth and the presence of a keratinous beak.  \n- The Nemegt Formation also yields abundant associated fauna (theropods, hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, crocodilians), allowing precise stratigraphic placement of Avimimus within a well‑dated sedimentary sequence.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- The tooth‑less beak and the lack of strong crushing jaws suggest a diet based on small, soft food items.  \n- Likely fed on insects, other arthropods, and possibly small vertebrates such as lizards or juvenile mammals.  \n- The long forelimbs and clawed hands may have been used to dig into leaf litter or soil to uncover hidden prey, similar to the foraging behavior of modern ground‑dwelling birds like roadrunners.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- During the Campanian, the Nemegt Basin was a semi‑arid floodplain with a network of braided rivers, seasonal lakes, and occasional forested patches along watercourses.  \n- The climate was warm with distinct wet and dry seasons, supporting a mosaic of open scrubland, riparian woodlands, and flood‑deposited mudflats.  \n- Vegetation included conifers, ginkgos, ferns, and flowering plants, providing both cover and a rich invertebrate fauna.  \n- Avimimus would have inhabited the open, lightly vegetated areas near riverbanks where it could run quickly to escape predators (such as the large tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus) and use its agile forelimbs to probe for insects in the substrate.  \n\nIn summary, Avimimus was a small, fast‑running, feathered theropod that occupied the edge of riverine ecosystems in Late Cretaceous Mongolia, feeding primarily on insects and other small prey while displaying a suite of bird‑like anatomical features that foreshadowed the evolution of true birds.",

    "output": "Bactrosaurus Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2 metres (6.5 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 1.5–2 tonnes.  \n\nGeological Time Range  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Cenomanian to early Turonian stages, approximately 95 to 90 million years ago.  \n\nFossil Localities  \n- First discovered in the Bayan Shireh Formation of central Mongolia.  \n- Additional material has been recovered from the Iren Dabasu Formation (Inner Mongolia, China) and from the Khara Khutul locality in the Gobi Desert.  \n\nPhysical Description  \n- Bactrosaurus was a medium‑sized hadrosaurid (duck‑billed) dinosaur with a relatively flat, broad snout and a short, beak‑like rostrum.  \n- The skull measured about 70 cm (2.3 ft) in length and possessed a modest nasal crest that ran along the midline of the skull, less pronounced than in later hadrosaurs.  \n- The dentition included a dental battery of tightly packed, leaf‑shaped teeth forming a grinding surface, ideal for processing plant material.  \n- The neck was moderately long, allowing the animal to browse at various heights, while the forelimbs were robust and capable of supporting weight when the animal moved on all fours.  \n- Hind limbs were powerful, ending in hooves that could also be used for rapid bipedal locomotion when threatened.  \n- Skin impressions suggest a covering of small, polygonal scales interspersed with larger, feather‑like structures along the tail and possibly the forelimbs, indicating a degree of proto‑feathering.  \n\nFossil Record and Preservation  \n- The holotype (IGM 100/201) consists of a partial skull, several vertebrae, ribs, and limb elements, providing a fairly complete picture of the skull anatomy.  \n- Numerous isolated teeth, dentaries, and post‑cranial fragments have been catalogued, allowing paleontologists to reconstruct the dental battery and limb proportions with confidence.  \n- Bone histology studies show relatively rapid growth rates, typical of hadrosaurids, with lines of arrested growth indicating seasonal fluctuations in resource availability.  \n- The sedimentary context (fluvial sandstones and mudstones) points to rapid burial in river‑channel deposits, which helped preserve delicate cranial features and some soft‑tissue impressions.  \n\nDiet  \n- As an herbivore, Bactrosaurus fed on a variety of low‑ to mid‑height vegetation.  \n- The dental battery was adapted for grinding tough, fibrous plant material such as conifer needles, cycads, ferns, and early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to diversify in the mid‑Cretaceous.  \n- Wear patterns on the teeth suggest a mixed feeding strategy: cropping foliage with the beak and then chewing it thoroughly before swallowing.  \n\nEnvironmental Setting  \n- The Bayan Shireh and Iren Dabasu formations represent a semi‑arid floodplain environment with seasonal rivers, lakes, and occasional swampy areas.  \n- Climate was warm with pronounced wet and dry seasons, supporting a mosaic of vegetation: riverine forests of conifers and ginkgos, open fern‑rich understories, and patches of early angiosperm shrubs.  \n- The ecosystem also hosted a diverse fauna, including theropod predators such as Tarbosaurus, smaller ornithopods, ceratopsians, and various crocodyliforms, indicating that Bactrosaurus lived in a community with both competition and predation pressures.  \n- Periodic flooding would have deposited fresh sediment, creating new growth zones for plants and providing the rapid burial conditions that preserved Bactrosaurus remains.  \n\nIn summary, Bactrosaurus was a medium‑sized, moderately crested hadrosaurid that inhabited the river‑dominated floodplains of what is now Mongolia and northern China during the mid‑Late Cretaceous. Its robust dental apparatus, adaptable feeding habits, and semi‑aquatic habitat allowed it to thrive in a dynamic environment that was undergoing significant botanical change as angiosperms began to spread.",

    "output": "**Bagaceratops Overview**\n\n**Scientific name:** Bagaceratops rozhdestvenskyi  \n**Common name:** Bagaceratops (“small horned face”)  \n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 1.2 – 1.5 meters (4 – 5 feet) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 0.6 meters (2 feet).  \n- Weight: estimated 15 – 25 kilograms (33 – 55 lb).  \n\n**Geological time range**  \n- Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage.  \n- Approximate age: 84 – 71 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil localities**  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, chiefly the Bayn Dzak (also called “Djadokhta”) and the Barun Goyot formations.  \n- Additional fragmentary material has been reported from the Nemegt Formation, also in southern Mongolia.  \n\n**Physical description**  \n- Small, bipedal herbivore with a compact, low‑slung body.  \n- Skull length about 20 cm (8 in); a short, deep snout bearing a modest nasal horn and a small frill at the rear of the skull.  \n- Beak‑like keratinous covering at the front of the jaws, followed by rows of leaf‑shaped cheek teeth suited for cropping vegetation.  \n- Robust forelimbs with five short fingers, the inner three bearing strong claws; hind limbs longer and built for rapid, agile running.  \n- Body covered in a mixture of primitive feather-like filaments (as suggested by related basal ceratopsians) and small, scale‑like skin patches.  \n- Tail relatively short, ending in a small bony club in some specimens.  \n\n**Fossil record**  \n- First described in 1987 by Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska from a partial skull and associated post‑cranial elements (holotype PIN 3142/250).  \n- Since then, more than a dozen specimens have been catalogued, ranging from isolated teeth and vertebrae to nearly complete articulated skeletons.  \n- The most complete specimen (IGM 100/2015) includes a nearly intact skull, vertebral column, pelvis, and both fore‑ and hind‑limbs, providing a solid basis for reconstructions.  \n- Histological studies of bone microstructure indicate rapid growth rates typical of small ornithischians, reaching adult size within 3–4 years.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous, feeding on low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and early flowering plants (angiosperms) that grew in the semi‑arid steppe.  \n- The beak and shearing cheek teeth suggest a diet of soft to moderately tough plant material, likely stripped from stems and leaves rather than heavily processed.  \n- Coprolite (fossilized feces) associated with Bagaceratops sites contain fragments of plant tissue and occasional pollen, confirming a plant‑based diet.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- Lived in a dry, open desert‑like ecosystem with seasonal rainfall, typical of the Late Cretaceous Gobi Basin.  \n- Landscape dominated by sand dunes, intermittent river channels, and occasional oasis‑like floodplains that supported sparse vegetation.  \n- Climate was warm to hot with large temperature fluctuations between day and night.  \n- The area hosted a diverse assemblage of contemporaneous dinosaurs, including small theropods (e.g., Velociraptor, Linheraptor), larger herbivores (e.g., Protoceratops, Saurolophus), and early mammals, indicating a complex food web.  \n- Periodic monsoonal storms would have created temporary water bodies, allowing bursts of plant growth that provided seasonal feeding opportunities for Bagaceratops.  \n\n**Summary**  \nBagaceratops was a diminutive, fast‑moving ceratopsian that inhabited the arid steppes of Late Cretaceous Mongolia. Its modest size, beaked mouth, and leaf‑shaped teeth made it well‑adapted to browsing low vegetation in a harsh, fluctuating desert environment. The relatively abundant fossil material from the Gobi Desert has allowed paleontologists to reconstruct its anatomy, growth patterns, and ecological role with a high degree of confidence.",

    "output": "**Bambiraptor feinbergi – Overview**  \n\n**Size**  \nBambiraptor was a small, agile theropod measuring roughly 1.2 to 1.5 metres (4–5 ft) in total length from snout to tail tip. Its hip height was about 0.5 m (1.6 ft) and it weighed an estimated 5–7 kg (11–15 lb), comparable in size to a modern turkey or a medium‑sized dog.\n\n**Geological Time Range**  \nThe species lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically in the Campanian stage, about 75 to 71 million years ago. This places it toward the end of the dinosaur-dominated era, a time when many advanced coelurosaurian groups were diversifying.\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \nAll known specimens of Bambiraptor have been recovered from the Two Medicine Formation of north‑western Montana, United States. The type specimen (MOR 662) was discovered near the town of Bynum in 1994, and additional fragmentary material has been found at nearby sites within the same formation.\n\n**Physical Description**  \nBambiraptor possessed a slender, lightly built skeleton with long, gracile hind limbs that suggest a high degree of cursorial ability. Its skull was relatively large for its body size, with a narrow, elongated snout, large orbits, and a set of sharp, recurved teeth suited for grasping small prey. The forelimbs were proportionally long, ending in hands with three functional digits; the second digit bore an enlarged, sickle‑shaped claw reminiscent of that seen in dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor. Feather impressions are not preserved, but phylogenetic inference places it among the feathered dromaeosaurids, so a covering of simple contour feathers and possibly more complex plumage for display or insulation is highly probable. The tail was stiffened by elongated caudal vertebrae and ossified tendons, providing balance during rapid turns.\n\n**Fossil Record**  \nThe primary specimen (MOR 662) consists of a nearly complete, articulated skeleton missing only the skull roof and some distal tail elements. This exceptional preservation allowed detailed study of its anatomy and confirmed its close relationship to the Asian dromaeosaurid *Microraptor*. Additional isolated bones—partial femora, vertebrae, and a few pedal elements—have been catalogued from the same formation, reinforcing the presence of a small, fast‑moving predator in the ecosystem. No known specimens have been found outside the Two Medicine Formation, making Bambiraptor currently endemic to this region.\n\n**Diet**  \nBambiraptor was a carnivore and likely an opportunistic predator of small vertebrates. Its dentition and jaw mechanics indicate a diet consisting of lizards, early mammals, juvenile ornithischians, and possibly hatchling hadrosaurs. The enlarged sickle claw on the second toe would have been an effective weapon for delivering slashing blows or for gripping prey while the animal used its strong forelimbs to hold onto struggling victims. Some paleontologists have suggested that it may also have supplemented its diet with insects or carrion, taking advantage of its agility and keen senses.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Campanian, the Two Medicine Formation represented a semi‑arid floodplain dotted with river channels, seasonal lakes, and occasional forested patches. The climate was warm with pronounced wet and dry seasons, supporting a mosaic of vegetation that included conifers, cycads, ferns, and early flowering plants. This landscape hosted a diverse dinosaur fauna: large herbivores such as *Maiasaura* and *Pachycephalosaurus*, smaller ornithopods, and other theropods like *Troodon* and *Dromaeosaurus*. Open areas would have favored the high‑speed pursuit tactics of Bambiraptor, while the occasional wooded sections provided cover for ambush hunting. The presence of abundant small vertebrates and a dynamic, seasonally changing environment made the region an ideal hunting ground for a nimble, feathered predator of Bambiraptor’s size.",

    "output": "Barapasaurus (Barapasaurus tagorei) was a large, early sauropod that lived during the Early Jurassic, roughly between 190 and 176 million years ago.  \n\nSize  \nAdult individuals are estimated to have reached lengths of about 15–18 metres (50–60 ft) and a shoulder height of 4–5 metres (13–16 ft). Body mass is thought to have been in the range of 12–15 tonnes, making it one of the larger herbivores of its time.  \n\nGeological period and range  \nThe species is known from the Early Jurassic, specifically the Sinemurian to early Pliensbachian stages. Its temporal range places it among the earliest true sauropods, shortly after the diversification of the group.  \n\nFossil locality  \nAll known Barapasaurus material comes from the Lower Jurassic Kota Formation of the Jaisalmer Basin in western India, near the town of Barap, from which the genus takes its name. The fossils were first discovered in the 1970s and have since been collected from several sites within the formation, including the famous “Barap” quarry.  \n\nPhysical description  \nBarapasaurus possessed the classic sauropod body plan: a long neck composed of at least 12 cervical vertebrae, a massive barrel‑shaped torso, and a long, tapering tail. The skull is poorly known, but the few fragments suggest a relatively small, elongated head with a blunt snout and large nostrils. Its teeth were spoon‑shaped (spatulate) and leaf‑like, adapted for stripping vegetation. The limbs were columnar and robust; the forelimbs were slightly shorter than the hind limbs, giving the animal a slight forward‑leaning posture. The vertebrae show early sauropod features such as massive neural arches and pleurocoels (air‑filled cavities) that would later become more elaborate in later sauropods.  \n\nFossil record  \nThe primary material consists of a partial skeleton: several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a series of caudal vertebrae, portions of the scapula, humerus, femur, tibia, and a few pelvic bones. In addition, isolated teeth and a fragmentary skull roof have been recovered. The bones are generally well preserved, though many are crushed or fragmented due to the sedimentary environment. The Kota Formation yields a relatively diverse assemblage of early Jurassic vertebrates, allowing Barapasaurus to be placed in a broader ecological context.  \n\nDiet  \nBarapasaurus was a high‑browsing herbivore. Its spatulate teeth indicate a diet of soft, fibrous plant material such as ferns, cycads, and early conifers. The long neck would have allowed it to reach vegetation at various heights, from low‑lying ground cover to mid‑canopy foliage. No evidence of gastroliths has been found, but it likely relied on a large gut for fermenting plant matter, as is typical for sauropods.  \n\nEnvironment  \nDuring the Early Jurassic, the region that is now western India was part of the Gondwanan supercontinent and lay near the equator. The Kota Formation records a semi‑arid to seasonally wet floodplain environment, with meandering rivers, oxbow lakes, and occasional swampy patches. The climate was warm, with distinct wet and dry seasons that supported a vegetation mosaic of ferns, horsetails, seed ferns, and early gymnosperms such as conifers and cycads. The presence of other contemporaneous dinosaurs, early crocodylomorphs, and temnospondyl amphibians suggests a relatively rich ecosystem in which Barapasaurus would have been one of the dominant primary consumers, moving in small herds or loose aggregations across the floodplain in search of food.",

    "output": "Barosaurus – Overview  \nSize: An adult Barosaurus measured roughly 30–33 metres (98–108 ft) in length and weighed between 15 and 20 tonnes. Its neck alone could reach 12–14 metres, making it one of the longest‑necked sauropods known.  \n\nGeological period: Late Jurassic, approximately 154 to 150 million years ago, during the Oxfordian to early Tithonian stages.  \n\nFossil locations: The majority of Barosaurus material comes from the Morrison Formation of the western United States, especially in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. Additional remains have been reported from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, indicating a broader Gondwanan distribution.  \n\nPhysical description: Barosaurus possessed a relatively slender, elongated body compared with other giant sauropods. Its neck comprised at least 15 cervical vertebrae that were unusually elongated and lightly built, giving the animal a “whiplash”‑like reach. The skull was small, low‑set, and equipped with leaf‑shaped teeth suited for stripping vegetation. The forelimbs were robust and columnar, while the hind limbs were slightly shorter, giving the animal a slightly inclined posture. The tail was long and tapering, likely used for balance and possibly as a defensive weapon.  \n\nFossil record: The genus was first described in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh, based on a partial skeleton (YPM 1912) from the Morrison Formation. Since then, more than a dozen specimens have been recovered, including several nearly complete series of cervical and dorsal vertebrae, portions of the pelvis, and limb bones. The abundance of vertebral material has allowed paleontologists to reconstruct the neck’s range of motion and to compare Barosaurus with close relatives such as Apatosaurus and Diplodocus.  \n\nDiet: Barosaurus was a high‑browsing herbivore. Its long neck enabled it to feed on foliage that other sauropods could not reach, such as the crowns of conifers, cycads, and ginkgophytes that grew on the edges of floodplains and in riparian woodlands. The peg‑shaped teeth were adapted for stripping soft plant material rather than grinding, suggesting a diet of relatively tender leaves and shoots.  \n\nEnvironment: Barosaurus lived in the semi‑arid, seasonally wet floodplain ecosystems that characterized the Morrison Basin. The landscape featured a mosaic of open savannah‑like plains, river channels, and scattered coniferous forests. Periodic monsoonal rains created lush riverbanks where vegetation was abundant, while the surrounding uplands were drier and supported drought‑tolerant plants. Barosaurus shared its habitat with other gigantic sauropods (e.g., Diplodocus, Camarasaurus), ornithischians such as Stegosaurus, and large theropods like Allosaurus, forming a complex community of herbivores and predators. The climate was warm temperate, with relatively mild winters and a pronounced wet season that promoted rapid plant growth, providing ample food for the massive herbivores.",

    "output": "**Baryonyx Overview**\n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 7.5–10 meters (25–33 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2.5 meters (8 ft).  \n- Estimated weight: 1.2–2.0 tonnes, depending on the individual and growth stage.\n\n**Geological Period**  \n- Lived during the Early Cretaceous, approximately 130 to 125 million years ago (Barremian to early Aptian stages).\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- First discovered in 1983 near Dorking, Surrey, England, in the Wealden Group (Valanginian–Barremian).  \n- Additional material has been found in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain – the “Baryonyx” specimen from the El Castellar Formation) and in Niger (a fragmentary specimen that may belong to a related spinosaurid).  \n- The English holotype (NHM R9951) consists of a partial skeleton with a well‑preserved skull, vertebrae, ribs, forelimb elements and the famous large claw.\n\n**Physical Description**  \n- Baryonyx possessed a long, narrow, crocodile‑like snout lined with conical, interlocking teeth, many of which bore fine serrations.  \n- The most distinctive feature is the massive, curved claw on the first digit of each hand, measuring up to 31 cm (12 in) in length.  \n- Its forelimbs were robust and longer than those of most other theropods, indicating strong grasping ability.  \n- The skull was relatively low and elongated, with enlarged nostrils placed high on the snout.  \n- The body was built for semi‑aquatic locomotion: a long, muscular tail for swimming, relatively short hind limbs compared with other large theropods, and a pelvis that suggests a semi‑sprawling gait on land.  \n- Skin impressions are lacking, but related spinosaurids show evidence of small, non‑overlapping scales; it is reasonable to infer a similar covering for Baryonyx.\n\n**Fossil Record and History**  \n- The holotype (NHM R9951) includes a partial skull, several dorsal vertebrae, ribs, a scapula, a humerus, a partial pelvis, and the iconic manual claw.  \n- Additional referred specimens from England (e.g., the “Wealden” material from the Isle of Wight) and Spain have expanded knowledge of its anatomy, especially the post‑cranial skeleton.  \n- The discovery sparked the recognition of the Spinosauridae family, linking Baryonyx with African taxa such as Spinosaurus and the South American Irritator.  \n- Recent CT‑scan studies of the skull have clarified the arrangement of the teeth and the presence of a secondary palate, supporting a diet specialized for catching slippery prey.\n\n**Diet**  \n- Primarily piscivorous: the conical, unserrated teeth and the elongated snout are ideal for snapping at fish.  \n- Stomach contents from the English holotype contained fish scales and fragments of a large teleost, confirming fish consumption.  \n- The large manual claw may have been used to hook or impale prey, suggesting occasional opportunistic feeding on small terrestrial vertebrates, carrion, or even crustaceans.  \n- Isotopic analyses indicate a diet that included a significant proportion of aquatic organisms, but not exclusively; Baryonyx was likely an opportunistic predator capable of exploiting both water and land resources.\n\n**Environment**  \n- Baryonyx inhabited the flood‑plain and coastal river systems of the Early Cretaceous Wealden landscape.  \n- The region was a warm, semi‑arid climate with seasonal rainfall, supporting extensive river channels, lakes, and swampy wetlands.  \n- Vegetation consisted of conifers, ferns, cycads, and early flowering plants, providing abundant shoreline habitats for fish and other aquatic life.  \n- The presence of abundant freshwater fish, amphibians, and small dinosaurs would have offered a varied prey base.  \n- Periodic flooding created dynamic habitats, allowing Baryonyx to move between water bodies and adjacent forested areas, using its strong forelimbs and tail for both swimming and terrestrial locomotion.",

    "output": "Becklespinax – an early Cretaceous theropod known from a handful of fragmentary remains discovered in the western United States.\n\nSize  \n- Estimated total length: about 6–7 metres (20–23 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2 metres (6.5 ft).  \n- Body mass: in the range of 800–1 000 kg (1,800–2,200 lb).\n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the early Cretaceous, specifically the Aptian to early Albian stages, approximately 125–110 million years ago.\n\nFossil locations  \n- The type specimen and most referred material come from the Cedar Mountain Formation of eastern Utah, USA.  \n- Additional isolated vertebrae and limb fragments have been reported from the nearby Morrison‑like strata of the Bighorn Basin in Wyoming.\n\nPhysical description  \n- Becklespinax was a bipedal carnivore with a slender, gracile build.  \n- The most distinctive feature is a series of elongated, low neural spines on the dorsal vertebrae, forming a modest “sail” that may have been used for display or thermoregulation.  \n- The skull, known only from a partial maxilla, suggests a narrow snout with recurved, serrated teeth adapted for slicing flesh.  \n- Forelimbs were relatively long, bearing three functional digits with sharp claws, while the hind limbs were powerful, ending in a typical theropod three‑toed foot.  \n- The tail was stiffened by elongated chevrons, providing balance during rapid running.\n\nFossil record  \n- The holotype (USNM 12345) consists of a partial dorsal series with six articulated vertebrae bearing the characteristic spines, a fragmentary left femur, and a partial right tibia.  \n- Additional material includes isolated dorsal vertebrae (UMMP 6789), a partial pelvis (BYU 1123), and several isolated teeth (UCMP 45678).  \n- All specimens are relatively well preserved, allowing detailed study of the vertebral morphology, but the lack of a complete skull limits precise phylogenetic placement.\n\nDiet  \n- As a medium‑sized theropod, Becklespinax was an active predator, likely preying on small to medium herbivorous dinosaurs such as early iguanodontians, basal ceratopsians, and ornithopods.  \n- The serrated teeth indicate a carnivorous diet focused on flesh, while the elongated forelimbs may have helped grasp struggling prey.  \n- Occasional gut‑content traces in related taxa suggest opportunistic scavenging, a behavior Becklespinax may also have employed.\n\nEnvironment  \n- During the Aptian–Albian, the Cedar Mountain region was a semi‑arid floodplain dotted with river channels, lakes, and occasional forested patches.  \n- Vegetation consisted of conifers, ferns, cycads, and early flowering plants, providing a mosaic of open ground and vegetated refuges.  \n- Climate was warm with seasonal rainfall, supporting a diverse assemblage of dinosaurs, early mammals, pterosaurs, and crocodilian relatives.  \n- The presence of the dorsal sail suggests that Becklespinax may have used it for visual signaling in the relatively open habitats, where visibility over distances was advantageous.",

    "output": "Beipiaosaurus (Beipiaosaurus inexpectus) is a feathered therizinosaurian dinosaur known from the Early Cretaceous of what is now northeastern China.  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 2.2 to 2.5 metres (7–8 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 1.2 metres (4 ft).  \n- Body mass: estimated 70–100 kilograms (150–220 lb).  \n\nGeological period  \n- Lived during the Early Cretaceous, specifically the Barremian to Aptian stages, roughly 130 to 115 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locality  \n- All known specimens come from the Yixian Formation of the Liaoning Province, near the town of Beipiao (the genus name honors this locality).  \n- The rocks are part of the Jehol Biota, a lagerstätte famous for exceptionally preserved feathered dinosaurs, early birds, mammals, insects and plants.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Small for a therizinosaur, with a long neck, robust fore‑arms ending in three large, curved claws, and a relatively short, deep tail.  \n- The skull is low and elongated, bearing a beak‑like rostrum and small, leaf‑shaped teeth suited for cropping vegetation.  \n- Body covered in a mixture of simple filamentous feathers (proto‑feathers) on the neck, fore‑limbs and tail, and a more down‑like feathering on the torso.  \n- The fore‑limbs are proportionally long (about 70 % of total body length) and heavily muscled, indicating a strong grasping ability.  \n- The hind‑limbs are slender, with a plantigrade foot posture and three weight‑bearing toes.  \n\nFossil record  \n- The holotype (IVPP V11559) consists of a nearly complete skeleton preserved in a single slab, including skull, vertebral column, limbs and a large portion of the integumentary covering.  \n- Additional referred specimens (e.g., IVPP V11560, V11561) provide variation in size and feather arrangement, confirming that the integument was widespread across the body.  \n- The preservation includes impressions of feather filaments, stomach contents (bits of coniferous foliage), and even a possible gut mass, giving rare insight into its biology.  \n\nDiet  \n- Beipiaosaurus was herbivorous, feeding on low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and conifer needles.  \n- The beak and leaf‑shaped teeth were adapted for stripping foliage, while the large manual claws may have been used to pull branches or dig for roots and tubers.  \n- Stomach content fossils show fragments of plant material, supporting a plant‑based diet, though occasional opportunistic ingestion of insects cannot be ruled out.  \n\nEnvironment  \n- The Yixian Formation represents a lacustrine (lake‑dominated) landscape with a temperate climate, marked by seasonal rainfall and volcanic ash falls that contributed to rapid burial of organisms.  \n- The area was a mosaic of conifer‑dominated forests, fern understories, and open water margins, providing abundant plant resources for a small herbivore.  \n- Volcanic activity created ash‑rich soils that promoted lush growth, while also preserving fine details of feathers and soft tissues in the fossil record.  \n- The ecosystem also hosted early birds, pterosaurs, mammals, and a variety of invertebrates, indicating a complex, biodiverse community in which Beipiaosaurus occupied the niche of a low‑browsing, feather‑covered herbivore.",

    "output": "Bellusaurus (Bellusaurus sui) was a small, early‑branching sauropod that lived during the Late Jurassic, roughly between 155 and 150 million years ago.  \n\nSize: Adult individuals are estimated to have reached about 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) in total length, stood roughly 2 metres (6.5 ft) tall at the hip, and weighed between 1 and 2 tonnes. The known specimens are juveniles, so the adult size is inferred from related basal sauropods.  \n\nFossil location: All material attributed to Bellusaurus comes from the Upper Shaximiao Formation in the Sichuan Basin of southwestern China, near the town of Zigong. The beds are part of a fluvial‑lacustrine system that deposited fine sandstones and mudstones.  \n\nPhysical description: Bellusaurus possessed a relatively short, robust neck compared with later gigantic sauropods, a modestly elongated skull with a beak‑like premaxilla, and a low, barrel‑shaped torso. Its limbs were columnar but not as massive as those of later titanosaurs; the forelimbs were slightly shorter than the hind limbs, giving it a slightly crouched stance. The tail was long and tapering, and the vertebrae show shallow pleurocoels (air‑filled cavities) indicating a lightened skeleton. The skin impressions suggest a covering of small, polygonal scales rather than the large osteoderms seen in some contemporaneous dinosaurs.  \n\nFossil records: The genus is known from a single, partially articulated skeleton (specimen IVPP V 11579) that includes most of the vertebral column, portions of the fore‑ and hind‑limbs, and fragments of the skull. The specimen is a juvenile, which has led to some debate about whether Bellusaurus represents a distinct taxon or a growth stage of another basal sauropod. No additional specimens have been recovered to date, making the known material limited but well preserved.  \n\nDiet: As a herbivore, Bellusaurus would have fed on low‑lying vegetation. Its leaf‑shaped teeth and spatulate front teeth are suited for cropping ferns, cycads, and the tender shoots of coniferous trees. The relatively short neck suggests it fed primarily at or just above ground level, browsing the understory of the Jurassic forest.  \n\nEnvironment: The Upper Shaximiao Formation records a warm, humid climate with abundant water bodies. The landscape was a mosaic of floodplains, river channels, and lakes fringed by dense conifer forests, ginkgoes, and abundant ferns. Seasonal rains created lush vegetation, providing ample food for large herbivores. The ecosystem also hosted theropods such as Yangchuanosaurus, stegosaurs, and early ornithischians, indicating a diverse community in which Bellusaurus occupied the niche of a mid‑sized, low‑browsing sauropod.",

    "output": "**Borogovia gracilis – Overview**  \n\n**Size**  \n- Length: approximately 2.5 – 3 metres (8–10 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: about 0.9 metres (3 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 30–45 kilograms (66–100 lb), comparable to a medium‑sized dog.  \n\n**Geological Time Range**  \n- Late Cretaceous, Campanian stage, roughly 76 to 73 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Nemegt Formation of southern Mongolia, near the Gobi Desert’s “Flaming Cliffs” (Bayanzag) region.  \n- Additional isolated teeth and fragmentary limb bones have been reported from the nearby Barun Goyot Formation, extending the known range slightly earlier in the Campanian.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n- Borogovia was a small, bipedal theropod belonging to the Troodontidae family.  \n- Skull: elongated and lightly built, with a narrow snout, large forward‑facing eyes, and a pronounced antorbital fenestra. The braincase shows evidence of an enlarged cerebrum, indicating high sensory acuity.  \n- Dentition: teeth are laterally compressed, serrated on the distal edge, and slightly recurved, suited for grasping small prey.  \n- Limbs: the forelimbs are relatively long, ending in a semi‑opposable hand with a large, retractable sickle‑shaped claw on the second digit, a characteristic troodontid trait. The hind limbs are slender but powerful, with an arctometatarsalian foot (the middle metatarsal pinched between the outer two), facilitating swift, agile running.  \n- Tail: stiffened by elongated caudal vertebrae and a series of ossified tendons, providing balance during rapid locomotion.  \n- Plumage: skin impressions from related troodontids suggest a covering of filamentous feathers; it is reasonable to infer that Borogovia possessed a downy feather coat, possibly with longer pennaceous feathers on the forearms for display or limited gliding.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- The holotype (IGM 100/1125) consists of a partial skull, several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a left femur, and a nearly complete right hind‑foot.  \n- Additional referred material includes isolated teeth (IGM 100/1130), a partial left tibia, and a set of forearm bones (ulna and radius) recovered in 1998.  \n- The specimens are housed at the Institute of Geology, Mongolian Academy of Sciences, and have been described in several peer‑reviewed papers (e.g., Osmólska & Barsbold 1987; Norell et al. 2006).  \n- No complete skeleton is known, but the available elements allow a reliable reconstruction of the skull and limb proportions.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- As a troodontid, Borogovia was likely an opportunistic omnivore. The tooth morphology indicates a diet that included small vertebrates (lizards, early mammals, juvenile dinosaurs) and invertebrates (large insects, arachnids).  \n- The enlarged brain and keen vision suggest active predation and possibly complex foraging behavior, such as probing leaf litter or digging for burrowing prey.  \n- Stomach content fossils are absent, but coprolites associated with other Campanian troodontids contain fish scales and plant fragments, supporting a mixed diet that may have included occasional fruits or seeds.  \n\n**Paleoenvironment**  \n- The Nemegt Formation during the late Campanian was a semi‑arid floodplain with a network of meandering rivers, seasonal lakes, and occasional swampy patches.  \n- Climate: warm temperate with pronounced wet and dry seasons; average annual precipitation sufficient to support lush riparian vegetation.  \n- Flora: dominated by conifers, ginkgos, and early angiosperm trees, interspersed with ferns, horsetails, and low‑lying shrubs.  \n- Faunal community: coexisted with larger theropods such as *Tarbosaurus* and *Therizinosaurus*, herbivorous hadrosaurs (*Saurolophus*), ceratopsians (*Bagaceratops*), and a diverse assemblage of small mammals, lizards, and amphibians.  \n- The mosaic of open floodplain and forested riverbanks provided abundant niches for a small, agile predator like Borogovia, allowing it to hunt in both open ground and dense underbrush while avoiding larger carnivores.  \n\n**Summary**  \nBorogovia gracilis was a diminutive, feather‑covered troodontid that roamed the floodplains of Late Cretaceous Mongolia. Its agile build, sharp senses, and versatile diet made it a successful small predator and scavenger in a landscape shared with some of the most iconic dinosaurs of the era. The relatively limited but well‑preserved fossil material continues to shed light on troodontid evolution, behavior, and the dynamic ecosystems of the Campanian Gobi.",

    "output": "**Brachiosaurus – Overview**\n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 22–26 metres (72–85 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height: roughly 12–13 metres (40–43 ft) at the shoulder; the raised front limbs gave the head a height of up to 15 metres (≈50 ft) above the ground.  \n- Weight: estimated 35–56 tonnes (77,000–123,000 lb).  \n\n**Geological Period**  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic, approximately 154 to 150 million years ago (Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian stages).  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- First described from the Morrison Formation of western North America (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming).  \n- Additional specimens recovered from the Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania (East Africa) and the Lourinhã Formation of Portugal.  \n- Isolated teeth and vertebrae have also been found in the Jurassic strata of Madagascar and the Middle East, suggesting a broader distribution across the supercontinent Laurasia and Gondwana.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n- A massive, quadrupedal sauropod with a distinctive body plan: forelimbs longer than hind limbs, giving a giraffe‑like, inclined posture.  \n- Neck composed of 13 elongated cervical vertebrae, capable of reaching high vegetation; the neck was relatively stiff compared to other sauropods.  \n- Skull: relatively small, elongated, with nostrils positioned high on the snout; teeth were spoon‑shaped, peg‑like, and spaced for stripping foliage rather than chewing.  \n- Tail: long and tapering, supported by robust caudal vertebrae; likely used for balance and possibly as a defensive whip.  \n- Skin impressions are rare, but related brachiosaurids suggest a covering of coarse, polygonal scutes interspersed with larger scale plates.  \n- Musculature: massive limb bones (humerus up to 2 m) indicate powerful forelimbs capable of supporting the elevated front of the body.  \n\n**Fossil Record**  \n- The type species, *Brachiosaurus altithorax*, is known from a partial skeleton including a nearly complete forelimb, several vertebrae, and fragments of the pelvis.  \n- *Brachiosaurus brancai* (often placed in the separate genus *Giraffatitan*) is represented by a near‑complete skeleton from the Tendaguru Beds, providing the most complete anatomical data for the genus.  \n- Numerous isolated bones (dorsal vertebrae, ribs, limb elements) have been catalogued in museum collections worldwide, allowing detailed studies of growth patterns, biomechanics, and phylogeny.  \n- Recent CT‑scan analyses of the Tendaguru specimen have revealed internal bone structure consistent with rapid growth rates typical of large sauropods.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous, feeding primarily on high‑canopy vegetation such as coniferous foliage, cycads, and ginkgophytes.  \n- The high browsing habit allowed Brachiosaurus to exploit food resources unavailable to lower‑grazing sauropods, reducing competition.  \n- Tooth wear patterns indicate a diet of soft to moderately fibrous plant material; the lack of complex chewing surfaces suggests food was swallowed whole and processed in the massive gut via microbial fermentation.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- Lived in semi‑arid floodplain ecosystems of the Late Jurassic Morrison and Tendaguru formations.  \n- The landscape featured river channels, seasonal lakes, and expansive open woodlands dominated by conifer forests, ferns, and horsetails.  \n- Climate was warm with distinct wet and dry seasons, supporting a diverse megafauna including other sauropods (e.g., *Diplodocus*, *Apatosaurus*), theropods (e.g., *Allosaurus*), and ornithischians (e.g., *Stegosaurus*).  \n- The elevated browsing niche of Brachiosaurus placed it among the tallest terrestrial animals of its time, allowing it to feed on the upper canopy of coniferous trees that reached 30 m in height.  \n\n**Summary**  \nBrachiosaurus was a gigantic, high‑browsing sauropod of the Late Jurassic, distinguished by its long forelimbs, towering neck, and ability to feed on vegetation far above the ground. Its fossils, found across North America, Africa, and Europe, provide a comprehensive picture of its anatomy, growth, and ecological role within the lush, seasonally variable floodplain environments that dominated the Jurassic world.",

    "output": "Brachylophosaurus – Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 9 to 10 meters (30–33 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 3 meters (10 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 4–5 metric tons.  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, approximately 81 to 76 million years ago, in the Campanian stage.  \n\nFossil localities  \n- Primary discoveries are in the western United States, especially in Montana (Horseshoe Canyon, Two Medicine, and Judith River formations).  \n- Additional specimens have been found in Utah (Cedar Mountain and Kaiparowits formations) and in the northern Rocky Mountain region of Canada (Alberta).  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Brachylophosaurus was a medium‑large hadrosaurid (duck‑billed dinosaur) with a broad, flat skull.  \n- The most distinctive feature is a low, wide, paddle‑shaped crest that runs across the top of the skull, formed by the nasal and frontal bones.  \n- It possessed a beak‑like rostrum for cropping vegetation, followed by a dental battery of hundreds of tightly packed teeth that formed a grinding surface.  \n- The body was robust, with a long, muscular tail used for balance, and relatively short forelimbs ending in five‑digit hands.  \n- Skin impressions suggest a scaly covering with possible small, polygonal scales; no definitive evidence of large feather-like structures has been found.  \n\nFossil record and significance  \n- The most complete and famous specimen is “Leonardo,” a nearly complete skeleton recovered from the Judith River Formation in Montana; it includes a well‑preserved skull, vertebrae, limb bones, and portions of the pelvis.  \n- Additional partial skeletons, isolated skulls, and numerous bone fragments have been catalogued, providing a good sample size for studying growth stages and variation within the species.  \n- Bone histology indicates rapid growth during the juvenile phase, with a slower, more prolonged growth period as the animal approached adulthood.  \n- Trace fossils such as trackways attributed to Brachylophosaurus show a semi‑sprawling gait and occasional herd movement.  \n\nDiet  \n- As a herbivore, Brachylophosaurus fed on a variety of low‑lying and mid‑height vegetation.  \n- The beak was suited for cropping ferns, cycads, conifer needles, and possibly early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were diversifying in the Late Cretaceous.  \n- The extensive dental battery allowed efficient grinding of tough plant material, suggesting a diet that included fibrous foliage and possibly seeds.  \n\nEnvironment  \n- The habitats where its fossils are found were part of a warm, semi‑arid floodplain ecosystem with seasonal rivers and lakes.  \n- Vegetation included conifer forests, fern thickets, and open scrubland, interspersed with wetlands that supported abundant aquatic plants.  \n- Climate was relatively mild with distinct wet and dry seasons, fostering a mosaic of habitats that could support large herbivore herds.  \n- Co‑existing fauna included other hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurs, theropod predators such as tyrannosaurids, and a variety of small mammals and reptiles, indicating a complex, dynamic ecosystem.  \n\nIn summary, Brachylophosaurus was a sizable, flat‑crested duck‑billed dinosaur that roamed the floodplains of western North America during the late Campanian. Its well‑preserved fossils provide insight into hadrosaurid anatomy, growth, and the rich, varied environments of the Late Cretaceous.",

    "output": "**Brachytrachelopan** – a little‑known sauropod from the Late Jurassic of South America  \n\n**Size**  \nBrachytrachelopan was a relatively small member of the diplodocoid sauropods. Adult individuals are estimated to have reached a total length of about 10–12 metres (33–39 ft) and a shoulder height of roughly 3 metres (10 ft). Its body mass is thought to have been in the range of 5–7 tonnes, considerably lighter than the gigantic sauropods that dominated other continents at the same time.\n\n**Geological age**  \nThe genus lived during the Late Jurassic, specifically in the Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian stages, roughly 155–150 million years ago. The age is constrained by the stratigraphic position of the fossil‑bearing beds in the Cañadón Asfalto and the Vaca Muerta formations of Patagonia.\n\n**Fossil localities**  \nAll known specimens come from north‑western Patagonia, Argentina. The most complete material was recovered from the Cañadón Asfalto Basin (Cerro Bayo locality) and from the Vaca Muerta Group near the Neuquén Province. These sites preserve a mixture of fluvial sandstones, mudstones and volcanic ash layers that have yielded articulated vertebrae, partial ribs, a few limb bones and isolated teeth.\n\n**Physical description**  \nBrachytrachelopan is distinguished by an unusually short neck for a sauropod. The cervical series comprises only about 12 vertebrae, each markedly shortened and robust, giving the animal a low, “giraffe‑like” profile with the head positioned close to the shoulder line. The neck vertebrae show deep lateral depressions (pleurocoels) and a series of elongated neural spines that likely supported strong neck muscles. The skull, known only from fragmentary maxillary teeth, was narrow and spatulate, typical of diplodocoids. The dorsal vertebrae are tall and columnar, while the tail is long and whip‑like, ending in a series of slender, elongated caudal vertebrae. The limbs are columnar and sturdy, with a relatively broad manus (hand) bearing five digits, the outermost reduced to a small claw. The overall body plan suggests a low‑browsing habit, with the animal able to graze vegetation close to the ground rather than reaching high into the canopy.\n\n**Fossil record**  \nThe holotype (MPEF-PV 1156) consists of a partial cervical series, several dorsal vertebrae, a fragmentary pelvis and a few limb elements. Additional referred material includes isolated caudal vertebrae (MPEF-PV 1157) and a set of teeth (MPEF-PV 1158). All specimens are preserved in fine‑grained mudstone, indicating rapid burial in a flood‑plain environment. The preservation quality is good enough to allow detailed histological studies, which have shown relatively fast growth rates for a sauropod of its size, suggesting a life history adapted to relatively unstable habitats.\n\n**Diet**  \nLike other diplodocoids, Brachytrachelopan was a herbivore that fed on low‑lying vegetation. The narrow, peg‑like teeth were adapted for stripping foliage rather than grinding, implying a diet of soft ferns, horsetails, and possibly low‑lying coniferous shoots. The short neck would have limited its feeding envelope to a vertical range of about 1–2 metres above the ground, favoring a grazing strategy similar to that of modern large herbivores such as hippos or elephants when they browse close to the ground.\n\n**Environment**  \nDuring the Late Jurassic, the Patagonia region where Brachytrachelopan lived was a semi‑arid to seasonally wet flood‑plain system bordering a shallow inland sea. The landscape was dominated by braided rivers, oxbow lakes and extensive mudflats, interspersed with patches of conifer‑dominated woodlands and open fern‑rich understories. Volcanic activity in the Andes to the west contributed ash falls that settled on the floodplains, creating the tuffaceous layers that now preserve the fossils. The climate was warm with pronounced wet and dry seasons, supporting a diverse assemblage of dinosaurs, including large theropods (e.g., Allosaurus‑like megalosaurids), smaller ornithischians, and other sauropods such as the larger diplodocids. The presence of abundant low vegetation and water sources would have provided ample forage for a low‑browsing sauropod like Brachytrachelopan, while its relatively small size and rapid growth may have been advantageous in a habitat subject to periodic flooding and volcanic disturbance.",

    "output": "**Buitreraptor Overview**\n\n- **Taxonomic placement**: Small dromaeosaurid theropod, member of the Unenlagiinae subfamily, closely related to other Gondwanan “raptor” dinosaurs.  \n\n- **Geological age**: Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage, about 83 to 78 million years ago.  \n\n- **Fossil locality**: Remains have been recovered from the Candeleros Formation of the Neuquén Basin in north‑western Patagonia, Argentina. The type specimen (MPCN-PV-598) was discovered near the town of Buitre, which gives the genus its name.  \n\n- **Size and build**:  \n  * Total length ≈ 1.8–2.0 m (6–6.5 ft).  \n  * Hip height around 0.6 m (2 ft).  \n  * Estimated body mass 8–12 kg (18–26 lb).  \n  * Light, gracile skeleton with long, slender hind‑limbs and a proportionally long tail that acted as a counter‑balance.  \n\n- **Physical description**:  \n  * Skull: elongated, low, with a narrow snout; teeth are small, recurved, and serrated, suited for grasping rather than crushing.  \n  * Forelimbs: relatively long for its size, bearing a well‑developed, sickle‑shaped second claw on each hand, similar to the more famous *Velociraptor*.  \n  * Hind‑limbs: robust femur and tibia, indicating strong running ability; the second toe also ends in an enlarged, retractable claw.  \n  * Feathers: impressions of filamentous integument have been found on related unenlagiines, and the preservation of quill knobs on the forearm of the holotype suggests Buitreraptor possessed a plumage of simple, hair‑like feathers, likely used for display, insulation, or limited aerodynamic control.  \n  * Skin: no direct evidence of scales, but the presence of feathers implies a largely feathered body with possible patches of scaly skin on the ventral surface.  \n\n- **Fossil record**:  \n  * Holotype (MPCN-PV-598) includes a partial skull, several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, a nearly complete left forearm with quill knobs, portions of the pelvis, both femora, tibiae, and several pedal elements.  \n  * Additional referred material (MPCN-PV-599, 600, etc.) consists of isolated teeth, vertebrae, and limb fragments that expand knowledge of its variability and confirm its presence throughout the Candeleros Formation.  \n  * The preservation is relatively good, with some bones showing fine surface details that allow reconstruction of muscle attachment sites and feather attachment points.  \n\n- **Diet and feeding behavior**:  \n  * Carnivorous, likely an active predator of small vertebrates.  \n  * Dental morphology (small, laterally compressed, serrated teeth) indicates a diet of lizards, early mammals, juvenile ornithischians, and possibly hatchling sauropods.  \n  * The enlarged sickle claw on the second toe and the strong forelimb claws suggest it could have used a “grappling” technique, pinning prey while delivering bites.  \n  * Its agility and speed would have allowed it to chase down fast prey or ambush from cover.  \n\n- **Paleoenvironment**:  \n  * The Candeleros Formation represents a semi‑arid to arid floodplain with seasonal rivers and occasional lakes, set within a broader Patagonian desert landscape during the Late Cretaceous.  \n  * Vegetation was dominated by xerophytic plants: conifers, ginkgophytes, and early flowering plants (angiosperms) forming scattered woodlands and scrub.  \n  * The ecosystem hosted a diverse fauna: large titanosaurs (e.g., *Futalognkosaurus*), other theropods (e.g., *Giganotosaurus*), iguanodontian ornithopods, crocodyliforms, turtles, and a rich assemblage of small mammals and lizards.  \n  * Seasonal rains would have created temporary water bodies, attracting herbivores and providing hunting opportunities for Buitreraptor.  \n\n**Summary**  \nBuitreraptor was a small, feathered dromaeosaurid that roamed the dry floodplains of Late Cretaceous Patagonia. Its lightweight, agile build, sharp claws, and modestly sized teeth made it an effective predator of small vertebrates in a landscape dominated by towering sauropods and a mix of arid and riparian habitats. The relatively complete fossil material from the Candeleros Formation provides one of the best windows into the anatomy and lifestyle of Gondwanan “raptor” dinosaurs.",

    "output": "Camarasaurus – Overview  \n--------------------------------  \n**Size**  \n- Length: about 15–18 meters (50–60 ft) from head to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 4–5 meters (13–16 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 18–23 tonnes (40,000–50,000 lb).  \n\n**Geological Time Range**  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic, approximately 155 to 145 million years ago, spanning the Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian stages.  \n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- United States: Colorado (Morrison Formation), Utah (Morrison and Cedar Mountain), Wyoming (Morrison), New Mexico, Texas, and Montana.  \n- Portugal: Lourinhã Formation (rare European record).  \n- Possibly also reported from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, though material is fragmentary.  \n\n**Physical Description**  \n- A large, quadrupedal sauropod with a relatively robust, barrel‑shaped torso.  \n- Neck composed of 12–13 elongated cervical vertebrae, allowing a moderate vertical reach but not as extreme as diplodocids.  \n- Skull: short, deep, and box‑like with large nostrils; teeth are spoon‑shaped (spatulate) and set in a broad dental battery, ideal for cropping vegetation.  \n- Tail: thick and muscular, ending in a tapered point; vertebrae are heavily pneumatic, reducing weight.  \n- Limbs: columnar fore‑ and hind‑limbs; the forelimbs are slightly shorter than the hindlimbs, giving the animal a slight upward‑sloping back.  \n- Skin impressions (rare) suggest a covering of small, polygonal scales rather than large osteoderms.  \n\n**Fossil Record and Notable Specimens**  \n- The type species, *Camarasaurus supremus*, is known from a nearly complete skeleton (CM 113) discovered near Garden Park, Colorado, in 1877.  \n- *C. lentus* and *C. grandis* are represented by multiple partial skeletons and isolated bones, especially vertebrae and limb elements, from the same Morrison deposits.  \n- The most complete articulated specimen to date is the “Camarasaurus” specimen (BYU 9040) from Utah, preserving most of the vertebral column, ribs, and limb girdles.  \n- Numerous isolated teeth and vertebrae have been recovered from bonebeds, providing a robust sample size for growth‑series studies.  \n- Histological analyses of Camarasaurus bone tissue show relatively rapid growth rates for a sauropod, with evidence of seasonal growth pauses.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous, feeding primarily on mid‑canopy vegetation.  \n- The spatulate teeth were well‑suited for stripping foliage rather than grinding; wear patterns indicate a diet of relatively soft coniferous needles, cycads, and possibly ginkgophyte leaves.  \n- Jaw mechanics suggest a relatively strong bite force for a sauropod, allowing it to process tougher plant material than some contemporaneous sauropods with peg‑like teeth.  \n- Coprolite (fossil feces) associated with Camarasaurus sites contain fragments of plant tissue, spores, and occasional conifer pollen, confirming a mixed plant diet.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- Lived in the flood‑plain and semi‑arid environments of the Morrison Formation, characterized by seasonal rivers, mud‑flat lakes, and scattered sand dunes.  \n- Climate was warm temperate with distinct wet and dry seasons, supporting extensive conifer forests, ginkgo‑like trees, ferns, and horsetails.  \n- The landscape included open woodlands interspersed with dense vegetative patches, providing both browsing opportunities and open ground for movement.  \n- Camarasaurus coexisted with other large herbivores such as *Diplodocus*, *Apatosaurus*, and *Brachiosaurus*, as well as predators like *Allosaurus* and *Ceratosaurus*.  \n- The presence of abundant water sources and rich vegetation made the Morrison flood‑plains a productive ecosystem that could sustain multiple massive sauropod species.  \n\nIn summary, Camarasaurus was a quintessential Late Jurassic sauropod: large yet comparatively robust, equipped with broad, spoon‑shaped teeth for a varied plant diet, and thriving in the seasonally wet, forested flood‑plains of North America’s Morrison ecosystem. Its abundant and well‑preserved fossil record makes it one of the best‑understood sauropods from this time period.",

    "output": "Camptosaurus – Overview  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 15–18 metres (50–60 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 3 m (10 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 4–5 tonnes.  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Late Jurassic, approximately 156 to 150 million years ago (Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian stages).  \n\nFossil locations (major sites)  \n- United States: Morrison Formation (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma).  \n- Portugal: Lourinhã Formation (Late Jurassic deposits).  \n- Possibly also reported from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, though material is fragmentary.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Stout, quadrupedal herbivore with a long, flexible neck and a relatively short tail.  \n- Skull: low and broad, with a beak‑like rostral tip and a row of leaf‑shaped cheek teeth suited for grinding plant material.  \n- Limbs: forelimbs robust, bearing five functional fingers; the first digit bore a large, curved claw, while the remaining digits were shorter and likely used for weight‑bearing.  \n- Hind limbs: longer than the forelimbs, ending in three weight‑bearing toes with blunt claws, indicating a primarily plant‑eating stance but capable of occasional bipedal locomotion when moving quickly.  \n- Body covered with a thin layer of filamentous proto‑feathers or simple skin scales, as suggested by related ornithopods.  \n\nFossil record and significance  \n- Over 30 relatively complete skeletons have been recovered, making Camptosaurus one of the best‑known Jurassic ornithopods.  \n- The type species, Camptosaurus dispar, was described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879 from the Morrison Formation.  \n- Several species have been named (e.g., C. amplus, C. aphanoecetes), though recent revisions suggest some may represent distinct genera.  \n- The abundance of specimens provides insight into growth series, showing juveniles with proportionally larger heads and shorter limbs that change as the animal matures.  \n- Bone histology indicates a relatively fast growth rate for a dinosaur of its size, suggesting a high metabolic demand.  \n\nDiet  \n- Herbivorous, feeding on low‑lying to mid‑canopy vegetation.  \n- Dental microwear and tooth morphology point to a diet of ferns, cycads, conifers, and possibly early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to appear in the Late Jurassic.  \n- The broad, grinding cheek teeth allowed efficient processing of fibrous plant material, while the beak could crop foliage.  \n\nEnvironment  \n- Lived in the semi‑arid floodplains and river valleys of the Morrison ecosystem.  \n- Climate was warm temperate with distinct wet and dry seasons, supporting a mosaic of conifer forests, fern thickets, and open scrubland.  \n- Seasonal rivers created lush riparian zones where Camptosaurus could browse on abundant foliage.  \n- Co‑existed with large sauropods (e.g., Diplodocus, Apatosaurus), theropods (e.g., Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus), and other ornithopods (e.g., Dryosaurus).  \n- The environment provided both abundant plant resources and a need for vigilance against predators, which may explain the animal’s ability to shift between quadrupedal grazing and bipedal sprinting.  \n\nIn summary, Camptosaurus was a large, robust, Late Jurassic herbivore that thrived in the diverse floodplain ecosystems of North America and Europe. Its well‑preserved fossil record offers a detailed picture of its anatomy, growth, and lifestyle, making it a key taxon for understanding the early evolution of ornithopod dinosaurs.",

    "output": "CARCHARODONTOSAURUS – OVERVIEW  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 12–13 metres (40–43 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 4–5 metres (13–16 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 6–8 tonnes, comparable to a modern African elephant.  \n\nGeological time range  \n- Lived during the Early to middle Cretaceous, approximately 100 to 93 million years ago (Cenomanian stage).  \n\nFossil locations  \n- First discovered in the Kem Kem beds of southeastern Morocco (near the Sahara).  \n- Additional material has been found in the Bahariya Formation of Egypt and in the Elrhaz and Gadoufaoua regions of Niger.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- A large, bipedal theropod with a massive skull measuring up to 1.8 m (6 ft) in length.  \n- The skull was deep and broad, equipped with a series of large, blade‑like teeth that were laterally compressed and serrated, resembling the teeth of a great white shark (hence the name “shark‑toothed lizard”).  \n- The jaws could open wide, allowing it to deliver powerful, slashing bites.  \n- The forelimbs were relatively short but robust, ending in three-fingered hands with large claws.  \n- The neck was muscular, supporting the heavy head, while the tail was long and stiffened by elongated chevrons, providing balance during rapid locomotion.  \n- Skin impressions suggest a covering of small, non‑overlapping scales, possibly with a faint pattern of darker stripes for camouflage.  \n\nFossil record and significance  \n- The holotype (specimen “MNN GDF 1000”) consists of a partial skull, several vertebrae, ribs, and limb fragments, providing a fairly complete picture of the skull anatomy.  \n- Subsequent finds have yielded isolated teeth, additional vertebrae, and partial pelvises, helping to refine estimates of body size and posture.  \n- Carcharodontosaurus is one of the three giant “carcharodontosaurid” predators known from the mid‑Cretaceous of Africa, alongside Spinosaurus and Deltadromeus, illustrating a diverse apex‑predator guild.  \n- Its fossils are relatively rare compared to the abundant spinosaurid material from the same formations, making each new specimen valuable for understanding theropod evolution in Gondwanan continents.  \n\nDiet  \n- Apex carnivore; prey likely included large herbivorous dinosaurs such as the titanosaurian sauropod *Paralititan* and the massive iguanodontian *Ouranosaurus*.  \n- The large, serrated teeth were adapted for slicing flesh and crushing bone, indicating a feeding strategy that involved both deep bites to incapacitate prey and scavenging on carcasses.  \n- Bite-force reconstructions suggest a powerful bite capable of breaking through thick hide and crushing rib cages.  \n\nEnvironment  \n- Lived in a semi‑arid, flood‑plain ecosystem that experienced seasonal rains.  \n- The Kem Kem and Bahariya formations represent river channels, deltaic deposits, and coastal lagoons, with abundant water sources supporting lush vegetation along the banks.  \n- Flora included conifers, cycads, ferns, and early flowering plants, providing food for large herbivores.  \n- The climate was warm and relatively humid during the wet season, turning drier and more open during the rest of the year, creating a mosaic of forested patches and open flood‑plain habitats.  \n- This environment supported a rich assemblage of vertebrates: other theropods (e.g., *Spinosaurus*), large herbivorous sauropods, ornithopods, crocodilians, turtles, and a diverse fish fauna, all of which formed the ecological backdrop for Carcharodontosaurus as the top terrestrial predator.",

    "output": "Carnotaurus (Carnotaurus sastrei)  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 7.5 to 9 metres (25–30 ft) from snout to tail.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 2.5 m (8 ft).  \n- Estimated mass: 1.5 to 2 tonnes.  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage, approximately 71 to 69 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Upper Cretaceous “Cerro Lisandro” and “La Buitrera” formations in the Neuquén Province of north‑western Argentina.  \n- The most complete and famous specimen (holotype MUCPv‑286) was found near the town of Villa El Chocón.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Carnotaurus possessed a deep, very short skull with a pair of prominent, horn‑like ridges above each eye, giving the animal its “meat‑eating bull” name.  \n- The jaws were lined with large, laterally compressed teeth, ideal for slicing flesh.  \n- Its forelimbs were extremely reduced, even shorter than those of Tyrannosaurus, with only two functional fingers.  \n- The hind limbs were powerful and built for speed; the femur was robust and the tibia relatively long.  \n- Skin impressions from the holotype show a mosaic of small, non‑overlapping scales, some of which formed a pattern of larger, keeled plates along the back and tail.  \n- The tail was deep and muscular, likely used as a counter‑balance and possibly as a rudder while running.  \n\nFossil records  \n- The primary specimen (MUCPv‑286) includes a nearly complete skull, partial vertebral column, pelvis, hind limbs, and portions of the forelimbs, providing a detailed picture of its anatomy.  \n- Additional, more fragmentary remains have been found in the same formations, confirming the presence of multiple individuals and allowing estimates of growth stages.  \n- No complete skeleton has yet been discovered, but the existing material is sufficient to reconstruct most of the skeleton with high confidence.  \n\nDiet description  \n- Carnotaurus was a top predator, exclusively carnivorous.  \n- Its blade‑like teeth and strong jaw muscles suggest it could deliver rapid, slicing bites, ideal for cutting through the flesh of large herbivores such as hadrosaurs and smaller sauropods.  \n- The reduced forelimbs indicate it relied on its massive jaws and powerful neck rather than grasping prey.  \n- Bite‑force estimates are moderate compared with tyrannosaurids, implying a hunting strategy that emphasized speed and ambush rather than crushing large bones.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \n- The sediments of the Cerro Lisandro and La Buitrera formations indicate a semi‑arid to arid floodplain environment with seasonal rivers and occasional lake beds.  \n- The climate was warm, with distinct wet and dry seasons, supporting a mix of open woodlands, scrubby vegetation, and riverine forests.  \n- This landscape hosted a diverse fauna, including titanosaurs, hadrosaurs, abelisaurids, and various crocodylomorphs, providing ample prey for a fast, apex predator like Carnotaurus.  \n- The relatively open terrain would have favored its long, slender limbs and ability to run at high speeds to chase down prey or patrol a large territory.",

    "output": "Caudipteryx is a small, feathered theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous period, roughly between 125 and 120 million years ago.  \n\nSize  \n- Length: about 1 meter (3.3 ft) from snout to tail tip.  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 0.5 meter (1.6 ft).  \n- Estimated body mass: 2–3 kilograms (4.5–6.6 lb).  \n\nPeriod range  \n- Early Cretaceous, Aptian stage, approximately 125–120 million years ago.  \n\nFossil locations  \n- All known specimens have been recovered from the Liaoning Province of northeastern China, chiefly from the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations, which are part of the Jehol Biota.  \n\nPhysical description  \n- Caudipteryus possessed a compact, bird‑like body with a short, deep skull, a beak‑like snout, and a reduced dentition (only a few small teeth in the lower jaw).  \n- The forelimbs were relatively short but bore a well‑developed, fan‑shaped plumage of pennaceous feathers extending from the hand to the forearm, resembling modern bird wing feathers.  \n- The hind limbs were long and robust, ending in a typical theropod foot with three weight‑bearing toes and a reduced fourth toe.  \n- The tail was short and stiffened by elongated vertebral processes, supporting a modest feather fringe.  \n- Skin impressions indicate a scaly covering on the belly and legs, while the dorsal surface was largely feathered.  \n\nFossil records  \n- The type species, Caudipteryx zoui, was described in 1998 from a nearly complete skeleton (specimen IVPP V11559) with exquisite feather impressions.  \n- Additional specimens include C. dongi (IVPP V12631) and several isolated skeletons and partial remains that have provided a clear picture of its anatomy and plumage.  \n- The fossils are preserved in fine volcanic ash layers, allowing soft‑tissue details such as feather barbules and melanosome structures to be studied, confirming the presence of dark, possibly iridescent coloration.  \n\nDiet description  \n- Dental and jaw morphology suggest a diet of small invertebrates, such as insects and arthropods, supplemented by seeds, fruits, and other plant material.  \n- The beak‑like snout and limited teeth are consistent with an omnivorous feeding strategy, allowing Caudipteryx to exploit both animal prey and available vegetation.  \n\nEnvironmental description  \n- Caudipteryx inhabited the lake‑rich, temperate forest ecosystems of the Jehol Biota.  \n- The region was characterized by a mosaic of volcanic ash‑covered floodplains, shallow freshwater lakes, and conifer‑dominated woodlands with abundant ferns, cycads, and early flowering plants.  \n- Seasonal climate was mild with distinct wet and dry periods, supporting a diverse community of insects, small mammals, early birds, and other feathered dinosaurs.  \n- The frequent volcanic activity contributed to rapid burial of organisms in fine ash, which is why the fossils of Caudipteryx are so well preserved.  \n\nOverall, Caudipteryx provides a key glimpse into the early evolution of feathers and the transition between non‑avian theropods and true birds, illustrating a small, feathered dinosaur well adapted to a mixed diet within a lush, lake‑filled Early Cretaceous landscape.",

    "output": "Cedarpelta is a medium‑sized ankylosaurian dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous in what is now the western United States.  \n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 6 to 7 metres (20–23 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 1.5 m (5 ft).  \n- Weight: estimated 2–3 tonnes.  \n\n**Geological time range**  \n- Early Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 80 to 77 million years ago.  \n\n**Fossil localities**  \n- The type specimen was discovered in the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah, USA, near the town of Cedar City (hence the name “Cedarpelta”).  \n- Additional material has been reported from the same formation in other parts of Utah and from the Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah, extending the known range within the same basin.  \n\n**Physical description**  \n- Like other ankylosaurs, Cedarpelta possessed a low, heavily armored body covered with osteoderms (bony plates) that formed a protective “coat.”  \n- The most distinctive feature is a well‑developed, broad, triangular “shield” over the shoulder region, formed by a cluster of large, fused osteoderms that give the genus its name (Greek “pelta” = shield).  \n- The skull is relatively short and wide, with a beaked mouth, small eye sockets, and a series of cranial ornamentations (spikes and nodules) along the rear of the skull roof.  \n- The tail lacks the massive terminal club seen in later ankylosaurids; instead it ends in a relatively simple series of stiffened vertebrae and small, overlapping plates.  \n- Limbs are short and robust, ending in broad, hoof‑like toes suitable for supporting great weight on soft floodplain soils.  \n\n**Fossil record**  \n- The holotype (USNM 5389) consists of a partial skull, several cervical and dorsal vertebrae, portions of the shoulder girdle, and a series of armor plates.  \n- Additional referred specimens include isolated osteoderms, a partial pelvis, and a few tail vertebrae recovered from the same stratigraphic horizon.  \n- The Cedar Mountain Formation preserves a rich assemblage of contemporaneous fauna (hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, theropods, and other ankylosaurs), allowing Cedarpelta to be placed within a well‑documented ecosystem.  \n\n**Diet**  \n- As a herbivore, Cedarpelta fed on low‑lying vegetation. Its beak could crop ferns, cycads, and the tough leaves of coniferous shrubs.  \n- The dentition consists of small, leaf‑shaped cheek teeth arranged in a grinding battery, suitable for processing fibrous plant material.  \n- Wear patterns on the teeth suggest a diet of relatively coarse foliage, likely supplemented by occasional soft shoots or fruit when available.  \n\n**Environment**  \n- During the early Campanian, the Cedar Mountain region was a warm, semi‑arid floodplain dotted with river channels, oxbow lakes, and seasonal wetlands.  \n- Vegetation was dominated by conifer forests, ginkgophytes, ferns, and flowering plants (early angiosperms) that grew along watercourses.  \n- The climate experienced marked seasonal rainfall, creating periods of lush growth followed by drier intervals, which would have influenced the availability of browse for large herbivores.  \n- Cedarpelta shared its habitat with a diverse dinosaur community, including hadrosaurids such as *Maiasaura*, ceratopsians like *Utahceratops*, and predatory theropods such as *Utahraptor*. The presence of abundant water sources and varied plant life provided ample foraging opportunities, while its heavy armor offered protection against these predators.  \n\nOverall, Cedarpelta represents an early branch of the ankylosaurid lineage, showcasing the evolution of extensive body armor and shoulder shields that would later become even more elaborate in derived ankylosaurs. Its fossils give valuable insight into the ecology of Late Cretaceous western North America.",

    "output": "Centrosaurus – Overview  \nSize: Adult individuals reached about 6–7 meters (20–23 ft) in length and stood roughly 2 meters (6.5 ft) tall at the hips. Body mass is estimated at 2–3 tonnes.  \n\nGeological time range: Lived during the Late Cretaceous, specifically the Campanian stage, approximately 76 to 73 million years ago.  \n\nFossil localities: The most abundant and well‑preserved material comes from the Belly River Group (also called the Judith River Formation) in southern Alberta, Canada, especially the Dinosaur Provincial Park and the nearby Milk River area. Additional specimens have been found in the Oldman Formation of Alberta and in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, USA.  \n\nPhysical description:  \n- Skull: Large, broad, and heavily ornamented with a distinctive nasal horn that curves upward and forward, and a pair of modest brow horns. The frill is short, wide, and bears a series of low, knob‑like spikes along its margin.  \n- Body: Stout, quadrupedal herbivore with a barrel‑shaped torso, robust forelimbs ending in five‑digit hands, and powerful hind limbs with three weight‑bearing toes.  \n- Skin: Evidence from fossilized skin impressions suggests a covering of small, polygonal scales interspersed with larger, keeled scutes along the back and tail.  \n- Tail: Thickened toward the base, likely used for balance and possibly as a defensive weapon.  \n\nFossil record and significance:  \n- Over 200 skulls and numerous partial skeletons have been recovered, making Centrosaurus one of the best‑known ceratopsians.  \n- The abundance of specimens allows detailed studies of growth series, population structure, and intraspecific variation.  \n- Several bonebeds (e.g., the \"Centrosaurus bonebed\" at the Dinosaur Provincial Park) contain dozens of individuals of varying ages, indicating possible herd behavior and mass mortality events, perhaps caused by flooding or drought.  \n- Histological analysis of bone tissue shows rapid growth rates typical of large ornithischians, with growth slowing as individuals approached adult size.  \n\nDiet:  \nCentrosaurus was a herbivore that fed on low‑lying vegetation. Its beak‑like rostral bone and leaf‑shaped cheek teeth were adapted for cropping and grinding tough plant material such as ferns, cycads, and the early flowering plants (angiosperms) that were beginning to diversify in the Campanian. The dental battery allowed efficient processing of fibrous foliage, while the strong neck muscles supported repeated chewing motions.  \n\nEnvironment:  \nDuring the Campanian, the regions of present‑day Alberta and Montana were part of a warm, semi‑arid floodplain within the Western Interior Seaway’s coastal plain. The climate was seasonally wet, with river channels, oxbow lakes, and extensive flood‑deposited sandstones and mudstones. Vegetation comprised a mosaic of open coniferous woodlands, fern thickets, and patches of flowering plants along river margins. Seasonal rains created lush growth periods, while drier intervals produced more open, grassy‑like ground cover. This heterogeneous landscape supported large herbivore herds, including Centrosaurus, which likely moved in groups to exploit the patchy resources and to reduce predation risk from large theropods such as Albertosaurus.  \n\nIn summary, Centrosaurus was a medium‑large, horned ceratopsian that thrived in the lush floodplain ecosystems of Late Cretaceous western North America, leaving behind a rich fossil record that provides insight into its biology, social behavior, and the environments it inhabited.",

    "output": "Ceratosaurus – Overview  \nSize: Adult Ceratosaurus individuals measured about 6 to 7 meters (20–23 ft) in length and stood roughly 1.2 m (4 ft) tall at the hips. Body mass is estimated at 500–800 kg (1,100–1,800 lb), depending on the specimen.  \n\nGeological time range: Late Jurassic, approximately 156 to 145 million years ago. The genus appears in the uppermost Jurassic strata of North America and Africa, with a few possible Late Jurassic occurrences in Europe.  \n\nFossil localities:  \n- United States: Morrison Formation (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas). The most complete specimens come from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry (Utah) and the Dinosaur National Monument (Colorado/Utah).  \n- Portugal: Lourinhã Formation (Late Jurassic).  \n- Tanzania: Tendaguru Beds (Late Jurassic).  \n- Possibly also in the Tendaguru region of Tanzania and the Upper Jurassic deposits of the Tendaguru Group in Tanzania.  \n\nPhysical description:  \nCeratosaurus was a medium‑sized theropod with a deep, muscular tail and a relatively low, broad skull. Its most distinctive feature was a prominent nasal horn, a single pointed horn on the snout that projected forward and slightly upward. Additional small horns adorned the brow ridge and the rear of the skull, giving the animal a “horned” appearance. The skull was about 60 cm (2 ft) long, with a short, deep snout and robust jaws lined with serrated, laterally compressed teeth. The forelimbs were short but powerful, bearing three-fingered hands with large claws. The hind limbs were long and built for fast, agile running; the foot had a typical theropod arrangement with a large, curved claw on the second toe. The body was covered in a modest covering of filamentous proto‑feathers, as suggested by related ceratosaurian relatives, though direct skin impressions are lacking.  \n\nFossil record and preservation:  \n- Over 30 specimens have been recovered, ranging from isolated teeth and vertebrae to nearly complete skeletons.  \n- The most complete skeletons (e.g., CM 11338 from the Cleveland‑Lloyd Quarry) preserve the skull, vertebral column, pelvis, and most limb elements, allowing detailed reconstructions of posture and musculature.  \n- Teeth are recurved, laterally compressed, and bear fine serrations, indicating a carnivorous diet.  \n- Bone histology studies show relatively rapid growth rates, typical of active predators of the Jurassic.  \n- Trace fossils (trackways) attributed to ceratosaurian theropods have been found in the same formations, confirming their presence in the ecosystem.  \n\nDiet:  \nCeratosaurus was a carnivore and likely an opportunistic predator. Its serrated teeth were suited for slicing flesh, and the robust jaw musculature could deliver powerful bites. Evidence suggests it hunted medium‑sized herbivores such as stegosaurs, ornithopods, and possibly juvenile sauropods. Bite marks on contemporaneous herbivore bones match the size and shape of Ceratosaurus teeth, indicating it may have also scavenged carcasses. The presence of a strong forelimb with large claws hints at a capability to grasp struggling prey.  \n\nEnvironmental context:  \nDuring the Late Jurassic, Ceratosaurus inhabited flood‑plain environments dominated by the Morrison Formation’s semi‑arid climate with seasonal rainfall. The landscape comprised river channels, mudflats, and overbank deposits surrounded by coniferous forests, cycads, and ginkgoes. Open woodlands and scrubby vegetation provided hunting grounds, while abundant water sources attracted herbivorous dinosaurs. The Morrison ecosystem supported a diverse assemblage of large sauropods (e.g., Apatosaurus, Diplodocus), armored stegosaurs (e.g., Stegosaurus), ornithopods (e.g., Camptosaurus), and other theropods (Allosaurus, Torvosaurus). Ceratosaurus likely occupied a niche as a mid‑level predator, using its speed and agility to exploit prey that larger apex predators might overlook, and possibly using its horns for display or intra‑specific competition.  \n\nIn summary, Ceratosaurus was a horned, medium‑sized Jurassic theropod with a distinctive skull ornamentation, a predatory diet focused on medium herbivores, and a habitat of river‑lined floodplains and forested uplands across what is now North America, Europe, and Africa. Its relatively abundant fossil record provides a clear picture of its anatomy, growth, and ecological role within the rich Late Jurassic ecosystems.",

    "output": "Cetiosauriscus – Overview  \nSize:   An adult Cetrosauriscus is estimated to have reached about 15–18 metres (50–60 ft) in total length and weighed roughly 12–15 tonnes. Its neck was relatively long but not as elongated as that of later sauropods, and the tail made up a substantial portion of its body length.  \n\nGeological age:   The species lived during the Middle Jurassic, specifically the Bajocian to Bathonian stages, roughly 170 to 166 million years ago.  \n\nFossil localities:   All known specimens come from the United Kingdom. The type material was discovered in the Oxford Clay Formation near Swindon, Wiltshire, and additional fragmentary remains have been recovered from the same formation in the Cotswolds and from the Great Oolite Group in Northamptonshire.  \n\nPhysical description:   \n- Skeleton: Cetiosauriscus possessed a robust, columnar limb structure typical of early sauropods, with massive femora and humeri that could support its great weight. The vertebral column shows relatively simple, low neural spines and modestly pneumatic (air‑filled) centra, indicating an early stage in the evolution of the sauropod respiratory system.  \n- Neck: The cervical series comprises about 12–13 vertebrae, giving the animal a moderately long neck that could sweep a wide feeding envelope but was not as flexible as that of later diplodocids.  \n- Skull: No complete skull has been found, but the few cranial fragments suggest a small, elongated skull with a blunt snout, typical of basal sauropods.  \n- Tail: The caudal series is long and robust, ending in a thickened “club‑like” tip formed by enlarged vertebrae, a feature seen in some other Middle Jurassic sauropods.  \n- Skin and integument: No direct skin impressions are known, but based on related taxa it likely bore a covering of small, polygonal scales, possibly with a thicker, armor‑like region along the dorsal midline.  \n\nFossil record:   The holotype (NHMUK R3522) consists of a partial post‑cranial skeleton including portions of the vertebral column, pelvis, and hind limbs. Since its discovery in the early 20th century, about a dozen additional specimens—mostly isolated vertebrae, ribs, and limb elements—have been catalogued in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London, and the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The material is relatively fragmentary, which has led to occasional taxonomic debate, but recent cladistic analyses consistently place Cetiosauriscus within the basal sauropod clade Eusauropoda.  \n\nDiet:   As a large herbivore, Cetiosauriscus fed on low‑ to mid‑height vegetation. Its teeth, inferred from related basal sauropods, were spoon‑shaped and spatulate, suitable for stripping foliage from ferns, cycads, and the early conifers that dominated Jurassic floodplains. The moderate neck length suggests it could browse both ground‑level plants and those up to about 4–5 metres high, exploiting a broad vertical niche.  \n\nEnvironment:   During the Middle Jurassic the Oxford Clay and Great Oolite regions were part of a warm, humid coastal plain dotted with rivers, lagoons, and shallow marine incursions. The climate was subtropical, with abundant rainfall supporting lush fern thickets, horsetail stands, and the first true conifer forests (e.g., *Araucaria*‑like taxa). Seasonal flooding created extensive mudflats and deltaic deposits where the sediment‑rich waters preserved the remains of Cetiosauriscus. The ecosystem also hosted a variety of contemporaneous dinosaurs (early theropods, stegosaurs, and small ornithischians), marine reptiles, and abundant invertebrates, providing a complex food web in which Cetiosauriscus occupied the role of a primary megaherbivore, shaping vegetation structure and influencing sediment dynamics through its massive movements.",

    "output": "**Cetiosaurus – Overview**\n\n**Size**  \n- Length: about 15–18 meters (50–60 ft).  \n- Height at the hips: roughly 3–4 meters (10–13 ft).  \n- Estimated weight: 10–15 tonnes, comparable to a modern elephant but much longer.\n\n**Geological Time Range**  \n- Lived during the Middle Jurassic, specifically the Bajocian to Bathonian stages, approximately 170–166 million years ago.\n\n**Fossil Localities**  \n- United Kingdom: the type specimen and most complete material come from the Oxford Clay Formation near Swindon (Wiltshire) and the Stonesfield Slate (Oxfordshire).  \n- France: isolated vertebrae and limb fragments have been recovered from the Callovian deposits of the Paris Basin.  \n- Portugal and Spain: a few fragmentary bones attributed to Cetiosaurus have been found in the Lusitanian Basin (Middle Jurassic strata).  \n- These sites are all marine‑influenced sedimentary rocks, indicating that the animals lived near coastal plains that were later inundated.\n\n**Physical Description**  \n- Body plan typical of early sauropods: long neck (≈ 7 m), massive barrel‑shaped torso, and a relatively short tail compared with later sauropods.  \n- Neck vertebrae are robust with low neural spines, suggesting a strong, muscular neck capable of holding the head low to the ground.  \n- Skull material is scarce, but reconstructions based on related basal sauropods show a small, elongated skull with a blunt snout and relatively simple teeth.  \n- Teeth are spoon‑shaped, leaf‑like (labiate) and spaced widely, suited for stripping vegetation rather than chewing.  \n- Limbs are columnar and pillar‑like; the forelimbs are slightly shorter than the hind limbs, giving the animal a slight forward‑leaning posture.  \n- Skin impressions are unknown, but it is reasonable to infer a thick, possibly scaly integument similar to other Jurassic sauropods.\n\n**Fossil Record and History**  \n- First described by Sir Richard Owen in 1841, Cetiosaurus was one of the earliest dinosaurs to be recognized scientifically.  \n- The original material consisted of a few vertebrae and a partial pelvis; since then, over a dozen specimens (mostly isolated bones) have been assigned to the genus, though many are fragmentary.  \n- The most complete skeleton, “Cetiosaurus oxoniensis” (specimen OUMNH J. 10366), includes a series of cervical and dorsal vertebrae, ribs, parts of the pelvis, and several limb bones, providing the basis for modern reconstructions.  \n- Recent phylogenetic analyses place Cetiosaurus near the base of the Sauropoda, making it a key taxon for understanding the early evolution of the group.\n\n**Diet**  \n- Herbivorous, feeding on low‑lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads, horsetails, and early conifers that dominated Jurassic floodplains.  \n- The shape of the teeth indicates a browsing strategy: the animal likely stripped foliage with its broad, spatulate teeth and swallowed it whole, relying on a massive gut for fermentation.  \n- No evidence of gastroliths (stomach stones) has been found with Cetiosaurus fossils, but it may have used them occasionally, as seen in later sauropods.\n\n**Environment**  \n- Lived in a warm, humid climate typical of the Middle Jurassic of Europe.  \n- The Oxford Clay and Stonesfield Slate represent coastal plain and deltaic settings with abundant rivers, lagoons, and shallow marine incursions.  \n- Vegetation would have been dense, with a mix of tall coniferous trees along riverbanks and a ground cover of ferns, horsetails, and low‑lying gymnosperms.  \n- Seasonal flooding created fertile floodplains that supported large herbivore populations; the presence of marine invertebrates in the same strata indicates that the area was periodically inundated by shallow seas.  \n- Predators likely included large theropods such as Megalosaurus and possibly early crocodile‑like archosaurs, but Cetiosaurus’s massive size and herd behavior would have offered protection.  \n\n**Summary**  \nCetiosaurus was a pioneering giant of the Jurassic, representing one of the earliest true sauropods. At 15–18 m long and weighing up to 15 tonnes, it roamed the lush, flood‑prone lowlands of what is now Britain and parts of western Europe. Its robust, low‑spined neck and simple leaf‑shaped teeth point to a low‑browsing herbivore that fed on the abundant ferns and conifers of the time. The scattered but informative fossil record, primarily from marine‑influenced sedimentary rocks, provides a window into the early evolution of sauropods and the dynamic ecosystems they inhabited.",
